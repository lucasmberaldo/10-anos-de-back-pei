TI  - Cross-Cultural Adaptation and Reliability of the Back Pain and Body Posture 
      Evaluation Instrument (BackPEI) to the Spanish Adolescent Population.

AB  - The prevalence of back pain (BP) among children and adolescents has increased 
      over recent years. Some authors advocate promoting back-health education in the 
      school setting. It is therefore important to adopt a uniform suite of assessment 
      instruments to measure the various constructs. The present study aimed to perform 
      a cultural adaptation of a validated measurement instrument (BackPEI), beginning 
      with a translation and cultural adaptation phase, followed by a second phase to 
      test reliability using a test-retest design. The translation and cross-cultural 
      adaptation were performed based on the guidelines. Reliability was tested by 
      applying the questionnaire to 224 secondary school students, at two different 
      times with a 7-day interval between the tests. In general, the Spanish version 
      presented adequate agreement for questions 1-20, with only question 9 achieving a 
      low Kappa range of 0.312 (-0.152-0.189). The question about pain intensity did 
      not show differences between the test means (4.72 ± 2.33) and re-test (4.58 ± 
      2.37) (p = 0.333), and the responses for these two tests obtained a high 
      correlation (ICC = 0.951 (0.928-0.966); p = 0.0001). Psychometric testing 
      indicated that the Spanish version of the BackPEI is well-adapted and reliable, 
      based on the test-retest design, providing similar results to the original 
      Brazilian version.

TI  - Association of postural education and postural hygiene with low back pain in 
      schoolchildren: Cross-sectional results from the PEPE study.
PG  - 157-165
LID - 10.34172/hpp.2023.19 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Low back pain (LBP) is the leading cause of disability in the world 
      that affects the population of all ages globally. The main aim of the present 
      study was to analyze the cross-sectional association of postural education and 
      postural hygiene habits with LBP, differentiating between frequency and intensity 
      of pain. METHODS: This cross-sectional study assessed 849 students aged 10-12 
      years from primary schools. The study was based on four different structured and 
      self-administered questionnaires: back pain questionnaire, Back Pain and Body 
      Posture Evaluation Instrument (BackPEI), Frequency of Commuting to and from 
      School Questionnaire, and the Hebacaknow questionnaire. In addition, height and 
      weight were included to determine the body mass index (BMI). RESULTS: 
      Participants with prevalence of LBP were significantly older (P=0.038), girls 
      (P<0.001), taller (P=0.018), and practice active travelled back from school 
      (P=0.016). Otherwise, participants with no prevalence of LBP sat correctly at the 
      desk (P<0.001). Higher knowledge of postural education was associated with lower 
      intensity of LBP (β=-0.07, CI=-0.12 - -0.02, P=0.004). CONCLUSION: The knowledge 
      related to postural education it is associated with less LBP. School 
      interventions improving knowledge about postural education, ergonomics and 
      postural hygiene are needed to address this important matter.

TI  - Thoracic Spine Pain in High School Adolescents: A One-Year Longitudinal Study.
LID - 10.3390/healthcare11020196 [doi]
LID - 196
AB  - Thoracic spine pain (TSP) is a common condition in the general adult population, 
      with a similar prevalence in children and adolescents. An in-depth understanding 
      of risk factors can assist in the identification of potential targets for 
      effective prevention strategies. This study aimed to determine the incidence of 
      TSP and ongoing TSP and identify its predictors in high school students. This 
      longitudinal study was conducted in 2017 (baseline-T1), and follow-up surveys 
      were completed in 2018 (T2). The variable "thoracic spine pain" was observed 
      using the Nordic questionnaire, and associated variables were observed through 
      the Baecke questionnaire and the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. 
      Statistical association methods were used for bivariate and multivariate logistic 
      regression analysis. Among the participants, the one-year prevalence (ongoing 
      TSP) was 38.4%, and the one-year incidence (new TSP) was 10.1%. Significant risk 
      factors for ongoing TSP were adolescent females (RR = 2.14), in the age group of 
      15 to 18 years (RR = 1.41), clinical mental health problems (RR = 3.07), 
      borderline mental health problems (RR = 2.02), mental health problems, sitting 
      while using a tablet (RR = 1.93), distance of the eye from cell phone screen of 
      or more than 20 cm (RR = 1.69), distance of the eye from the PC screen of or more 
      than 30 cm (RR = 1.53), cell phone mobile use duration of or more than 3 h (RR = 
      1.60), tablet use time of or more than 3 h (RR = 2.08), and semi-lying prone 
      position while using the cell phone (RR= 1.47), and these were also significant 
      predictors of TSP episodes. Significant risk factors for new TSP were adolescent 
      female sex (RR = 1.88), level, clinical mental health problems (RR = 4.26), 
      borderline mental health problems (RR = 2.07), semi-lying prone position while 
      using cell phone (RR = 1.71) or tablet (RR = 2.31), and mobile phone use duration 
      equal to or greater than 3 h (RR = 1.72). We conclude that there is a high 
      prevalence of TSP in high school students, which is associated with the female 
      sex, mental health problems, and use of electronic devices for an inappropriate 
      duration in an improper position.

      Cross-Sectional Study.
LID - 10.3390/children9091291 [doi]
LID - 1291
AB  - Knowledge is a determining factor for the development of postural habits; it 
      could be considered as the first step in the establishment of changes. The aim of 
      this study was to analyze the level of specific back-health-related physical 
      activity and exercise knowledge in adolescents. A cross-sectional study was 
      conducted on a sample of 1500 high school students between the ages of 13 and 18 
      (mean age = 15.18 ± 1.44). Students from the Valencian Community (Spain) were 
      recruited with a confidence level of 95% and an accepted standard error of ± 
      2.53%. Self-report questionnaires were used to record back-health-related 
      physical activity knowledge. The level of specific knowledge of back-health 
      education related to physical activity and exercise in adolescents was low (X = 
      2.05 ± 2.26). Only 10.9% of the students passed the specific knowledge test, 
      achieving a score equal or superior to 5. The boys’ average score was higher (X = 
      2.17 ± 2.31) than the girls’ (X = 1.94 ± 2.21) with statistically significant 
      differences (p = 0.048). The level of specific knowledge increased with age (p < 
      0.001). Secondary school students show a low level of specific knowledge 
      concerning back health. It is recommended that back care education be a part of 
      school curriculum.

TI  - Tools for Assessing Knowledge of Back Health in Adolescents: A Systematic Review 
      Protocol.
LID - 10.3390/healthcare10081591 [doi]
LID - 1591
AB  - Back pain is common in adolescents as a result of their typical daily activities. 
      There is a critical need for developing instruments that can assess the 
      adolescents' knowledge of proper posture, because adequate postural habits are 
      essential for preventing back pain and facilitating physical well-being. 
      Unfortunately, there is insufficient understanding about appropriate back health 
      in the general public, even though this knowledge is decisive in the development 
      of physical skills and attainment of health literacy. Furthermore, relevant 
      substantive literature is scarce. Therefore, the proposed systematic review aims 
      to identify instruments that are used for assessing knowledge of back health in 
      adolescents. Relevant search terms and descriptors will be combined, and searches 
      will be carried out in a uniform sequence within the PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, and 
      Cochrane Library databases. Eligible articles must present data on the assessment 
      of the adolescents' knowledge of back health and describe the applied 
      instrumentation. Articles will be selected by two reviewers independently; all 
      disagreements will be resolved by a third reviewer. Mendeley and the Rayyan 
      software will be used for the systematic review, and the checklist proposed by 
      Brink and Louw will be used to verify the methodological quality of the included 
      studies. Our findings may confirm the relevance of constructing and validating 
      back health instruments for use in Brazil and other countries.

TI  - Back Pain and Body Posture Evaluation Instrument for Children and Adolescents 
      (BackPEI-CA): Expansion, Content Validation, and Reliability.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19031398 [doi]
LID - 1398
AB  - The Back Pain and Body Posture Evaluation Instrument (BackPEI) was created in 
      2013 to assess back pain and its risk factors in school children. However, it 
      does not assess neck pain or the habits of mobile device usage, which are aspects 
      that are often part of school children's lives. Therefore, we aimed to update the 
      BackPEI questionnaire to include new questions assessing aspects related to neck 
      pain and the use of mobile devices and to test the content validity and 
      reliability of the new questions. The updated questionnaire was named Back Pain 
      and Body Posture Evaluation Instrument for Children and Adolescents (BackPEI-CA). 
      The content was validated by eight experts using the content validity index 
      (CVI). To assess reliability, the BackPEI-CA questionnaire was applied at two 
      different times in 105 school children, and Cohen's kappa (k) and intraclass 
      correlation coefficient (ICC) were calculated. All aspects assessed regarding 
      content validity had a CVI higher than 0.8. The new questions presented moderate 
      and good kappa values and excellent ICC values. The updated version of BackPEI-CA 
      can be used as a clinic tool for assessing the presence, frequency, and intensity 
      of back and neck pain and their risk factors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Back school programs, that improve back care and spine disease 
      prevention knowledge are recommended at the age of 4-14 years. There is Health 
      Questionnaire on Back Care Knowledge in the literature for children aged 14-17 
      years. At other ages, there is no questionnaire examining this knowledge. We 
      aimed to develop a Health Questionnaire on Back Care and Spine Disease Prevention 
      Knowledge for 6-10 years old children and validate its psychometric properties 
      (internal consistency, test-retest reliability, agreement, convergent validity, 
      discriminant validity) in 6-10 years old children, who attended back school 
      program or not. METHODS: 463 children took part in the research (6-10 years old). 
      The development was performed according to the Delphi method. The final version 
      contained 7 questions. 463 participants completed the questionnaire twice with an 
      interval of 7 days to evaluate test-retest reliability. The internal consistency 
      was tested by Cronbach's alpha value, test-retest reliability was calculated by 
      Intraclass Correlation Coefficients (ICC), Standard Error of Measurement (SEM) 
      and 95% of Minimal Detectable Change (MDC95) and Bland-Altman plots. Convergent 
      validity was tested against the age variable and discriminant validity was tested 
      by Kruskal-Wallis tests among the different subgroups. RESULTS: Cronbach's alpha 
      of the total score was (α=0.797), showed a strong internal consistency with 
      minimal SEM (0.606) and MDC95 (1.680). The test-retest result for the total score 
      was strong (0.989), for the questions showed moderate to strong results 
      (0.742-0.975), the limits of agreement of the Bland-Altman plot showed a narrow 
      error of measurement range (-3.49-1.29), and the value of mean differences was 
      -1.10 (SD ± 1.22). The convergent validity showed a weak, but significant 
      relationship between total score and age (R=0.171; p < 0.001). The discriminant 
      validity showed significantly different mean scores in non-back school and back 
      school groups. CONCLUSION: For the examination of back care and spine disease 
      prevention knowledge of 6-10 years old children, the questionnaire proved to be a 
      valid and reliable tool. The knowledge requested in the questionnaire covers the 
      knowledge material of the theoretical part of the back school for children aged 
      4-10 years.

TI  - Teaching Back Health in the School Setting: A Systematic Review of Randomized 
      Controlled Trials.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph18030979 [doi]
LID - 979
AB  - School-based interventions have reported effectiveness on back health; however, 
      there are no specific guidelines for teaching body mechanics and posture in 
      primary and secondary schools. To identify, describe, and analyze the educative 
      features of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on back health developed to date 
      in the school setting, a systematic review was performed following the preferred 
      reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) 
      recommendations. RCTs exclusively focused on educational setting electronic 
      databases included PubMed, EMBASE, PEDro, Web of Science, SPORTDiscus, ERIC, and 
      MEDLINE on the Ovid platform. Databases were searched for potentially eligible 
      studies from the earliest date up to 18th March 2020. A total of 584 records were 
      obtained from the database searches. A total of six articles that applied 
      inclusion criteria were assessed for eligibility. All of these studies found 
      improvements in postural habits and the level of knowledge with regard to back 
      health, as well as a reduction in the prevalence of back pain. None of the 
      studies used the student-centered method, and three studies used evaluation 
      instruments with a pilot validation. Research on RCT interventions concerning 
      back health in the school setting is scarce. None of the interventions applied a 
      constructivist or student-centered method. The use of validated and standardized 
      assessment instruments is required.
