AB  - INTRODUCTION: Back Pain and Body Posture Evaluation Instrument for Adults 
      (BackPEI-A) lags the most recent literature, as it does not assess issues related 
      to activity increasingly present in the daily lives of people of all ages. 
      PURPOSE: (1) to update the BackPEI-A by including four new questions regarding 
      the use of mobile devices; (2) to present a new graphic design of the issues 
      related to back and neck pain to facilitate understanding of the location of 
      these pains; (3) to test the content validity and the reliability of the new 
      questions; and (4) to identify whether the BackPEI-A version in online form has 
      adequate reliability. METHODS: The content validation by evaluation of eight 
      experts, and the reliability of the new questions and of the online version were 
      assessed. The new questions were translated to English. Content validation was 
      assessed by the content validity index (CVI). Reliability was assessed using the 
      agreement percentage (%C), the kappa statistic (k), and the intraclass 
      correlation coefficient (ICC). k > 0.4 and %C > 0.5 were assumed to include new 
      questions. RESULTS: The new questions showed good agreement among the experts, 
      k > 0.4 and %C > 0.5. Both forms applied presented an average kappa of total 
      sample ranging from moderate to good, and moderate ICC values, showing an 
      adequate reliability. CONCLUSION: The updated BackPEI-A is valid and reliable and 
      allows the identification of aspects related to back and neck pain, as well as 
      possible risk factors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The BackPEI questionnaire was developed and validated just 
      exclusively to evaluate children. AIMS: To propose, validate, and test the 
      reproducibility of an expanded version of the Back Pain and Body Posture 
      Evaluation Instrument (BackPEI), originally designed to assess back pain in 
      school-aged children, for use with adults. DESIGN: Validation Study. METHODS: 
      Five questions from the original BackPEI were replaced, resulting in the revised 
      instrument (BackPEI-A) containing 20 questions. Three experts checked the content 
      validity of the revised instrument, and the reproducibility was tested by 
      trialing the questionnaire with 154 adults. RESULTS: The reproducibility data for 
      the questions regarding pain intensity, analyzed using the Wilcoxon test and 
      intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), indicated that (a) there was no 
      difference between the medians and (b) the answers were highly correlated, both 
      for lower back (p = .574) (ICC = 0.908) and cervical (p = .968) (ICC = 0.865) 
      pain. The reproducibility data for the remaining questions analyzed using the κ 
      coefficient were classified as moderate (0.4 < κ ≤ 0.6) or very good (κ > 0.8). 
      CONCLUSION: The BackPEI-A is a reproducible, valid, and reliable instrument for 
      use in the evaluation of back and neck pain and their associated risk factors. 
      The instrument also facilitates the evaluation of postural habits in activities 
      of daily living in adults.

LID - 1398
AB  - The Back Pain and Body Posture Evaluation Instrument (BackPEI) was created in 
      2013 to assess back pain and its risk factors in school children. However, it 
      does not assess neck pain or the habits of mobile device usage, which are aspects 
      that are often part of school children's lives. Therefore, we aimed to update the 
      BackPEI questionnaire to include new questions assessing aspects related to neck 
      pain and the use of mobile devices and to test the content validity and 
      reliability of the new questions. The updated questionnaire was named Back Pain 
      and Body Posture Evaluation Instrument for Children and Adolescents (BackPEI-CA). 
      The content was validated by eight experts using the content validity index 
      (CVI). To assess reliability, the BackPEI-CA questionnaire was applied at two 
      different times in 105 school children, and Cohen's kappa (k) and intraclass 
      correlation coefficient (ICC) were calculated. All aspects assessed regarding 
      content validity had a CVI higher than 0.8. The new questions presented moderate 
      and good kappa values and excellent ICC values. The updated version of BackPEI-CA 
      can be used as a clinic tool for assessing the presence, frequency, and intensity 
      of back and neck pain and their risk factors.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Following a search conducted in several databases, no instrument was 
      found that jointly evaluates the prevalence of back pain and its associated 
      demographic, social-economic, hereditary, behavioral and postural risk factors. 
      Thus, the present study aims to develop the Back Pain and Body Posture Evaluation 
      Instrument (BackPEI) for school-age children and verify its validity and 
      reproducibility. METHODS: Twenty-one questions were elaborated to compose the 
      BackPEI instrument, eight experts checked the content validity, and its 
      reproducibility was tested by applying the questionnaire to 260 primary 
      schoolchildren, at two different times with a 7-day interval. RESULTS: The 
      reproducibility data for the first 20 questions, analyzed using the kappa (k) 
      coefficient, were classified as "very good" (k > 0.8) or "good" (0.6 < k ≤ 0.8). 
      The reproducibility data for the pain intensity question, analyzed using the 
      Wilcoxon test and the intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), demonstrated 
      that there was no difference between the averages (p = 0.251) and the responses 
      were highly correlated (ICC = 0.937) for these two tests. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      BackPEI constitutes a valid and reproducible instrument which is relevant for the 
      evaluation of back pain and its associated risk factors.

TI  - Back pain and its risk factors in Brazilian adolescents: a longitudinal study.
PG  - 16-25
LID - 10.1177/2049463719871751 [doi]
AB  - Owing to the lack of longitudinal studies in Latin American countries, we aimed 
      to evaluate back pain and its risk factors in a 3-year longitudinal study of 
      Brazilian adolescents. We analysed data of 525 adolescents (aged 11-16 years) 
      attending primary school (fifth to eighth grade) in Brazil. The students were 
      administered the self-reported Back Pain and Body Posture Evaluation Instrument 
      (BackPEI) questionnaire in 2011 and at a follow-up evaluation that was conducted 
      3 years later (2014). Back pain was the outcome variable; the exposure variables 
      included exercise, behavioural, hereditary and postural factors. Generalized 
      estimating equations were used to perform a Poisson regression model with robust 
      variance to evaluate the risk factors for back pain. The prevalence of back pain 
      at baseline was 56% (n = 294); this increased significantly at the 3-year 
      follow-up evaluation to 65.9% (n = 346). The frequency of experiencing back pain 
      also significantly increased after 3 years in both boys (p = 0.002) and girls 
      (p = 0.001). The prevalence of back pain increased significantly in adolescents 
      up to the age of 13 years, stabilized in those aged 14 years and older and was 
      higher among girls. A family history of back pain (in the parents), watching 
      television for lengthy periods and carrying a backpack asymmetrically were 
      predictors for back pain.

TI  - Cross-Cultural Adaptation and Reliability of the Back Pain and Body Posture 
      Evaluation Instrument (BackPEI) to the Spanish Adolescent Population.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph18030854 [doi]
LID - 854
AB  - The prevalence of back pain (BP) among children and adolescents has increased 
      over recent years. Some authors advocate promoting back-health education in the 
      school setting. It is therefore important to adopt a uniform suite of assessment 
      instruments to measure the various constructs. The present study aimed to perform 
      a cultural adaptation of a validated measurement instrument (BackPEI), beginning 
      with a translation and cultural adaptation phase, followed by a second phase to 
      test reliability using a test-retest design. The translation and cross-cultural 
      adaptation were performed based on the guidelines. Reliability was tested by 
      applying the questionnaire to 224 secondary school students, at two different 
      times with a 7-day interval between the tests. In general, the Spanish version 
      presented adequate agreement for questions 1-20, with only question 9 achieving a 
      low Kappa range of 0.312 (-0.152-0.189). The question about pain intensity did 
      not show differences between the test means (4.72 ± 2.33) and re-test (4.58 ± 
      2.37) (p = 0.333), and the responses for these two tests obtained a high 
      correlation (ICC = 0.951 (0.928-0.966); p = 0.0001). Psychometric testing 
      indicated that the Spanish version of the BackPEI is well-adapted and reliable, 
      based on the test-retest design, providing similar results to the original 
      Brazilian version.

AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of the study was to evaluate musculoskeletal pain due to 
      mechanical reasons and related risk factors in adolescents and to define posture 
      profiles of adolescents. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study. METHODS: The study was 
      conducted with 2221 adolescents between February 2015 and May 2015. The 
      questionnaire used to collect data consisted of three parts: (1) descriptive 
      characteristics of the participants, (2) pain assessment of 14 parts of the body, 
      and (3) Back Pain and Body Posture Evaluation Instrument (BackPEI). RESULTS: The 
      prevalence of low back pain among the participants was 73.3% (n = 1,343), while 
      the prevalence of back pain was 68.4% (n = 1,254). The participants attributed 
      their pain to their poor sitting postures at school (38.1%, n = 847) and carrying 
      school backpacks (84.1%, n = 1,713). There was a statistically significant 
      difference in the physical activities of adolescents and the BackPEI score 
      (z = 4.40; p = .001). Posture factors of the BackPEI score increased while school 
      desk comfort score increased (Spearman's rho = 0.148; p = .001), but it decreased 
      while the school grades of the adolescents increased (Spearman's rho 
      [ρ] = -0.161; p = .001). CONCLUSIONS: According to this study, body posture was 
      related to musculoskeletal pain and was correlated with physical activities, 
      school desk comfort, and school grades of the adolescents. It is suggested that 
      correct posture and ergonomic positions should be taught to adolescents when 
      using computers, carrying school backpacks, and sitting in school chairs to 
      prevent musculoskeletal pain.

AB  - PURPOSE: Back pain is a growing problem worldwide, not only in adults but also in 
      children. Therefore, it is becoming increasingly important to investigate and 
      understand the factors that influence the early onset of back pain. The aim of 
      this study was to determine the prevalence of back pain in children and 
      adolescents and to identify predisposing risk factors and protective factors. 
      METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted between October and December 2019 
      in schools from northern Portugal, evaluating 1463 students aged 9 to 19 years, 
      of both genders. The instruments used were the Spinal Mouse® to assess posture, 
      the Inbody 230® to assess body composition, an online questionnaire to 
      characterize the sample and back pain, and the FITescola® battery test to access 
      physical fitness. RESULTS: Half of the subjects experienced back pain at least 
      once in their lifetime. The most frequently mentioned were lumbar spine and 
      thoracic spine, mostly with mild or moderate pain intensities. Age, female 
      gender, percent body fat, prolonged smartphone and computer use, hyperkyphosis, 
      and the lateral global spine tilt to the left side are all factors with higher 
      relative risk of back pain. Practicing physical activity or sports regularly and 
      video games have a protective effect. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of back pain in 
      children and adolescents is very high: The study enhances the case for protective 
      factors such as physical activity habits or video games while reinforcing risk 
      factors such as percent body fat, prolonged smartphone or computer use, and 
      posture.

      Prospective Cohort Study.

LID - 8322
AB  - Risk factors associated with back pain vary in different countries. Given the 
      lack of studies in Latin America, our study aimed to assess back pain and its 
      associated factors for six years in Southern Brazilian school children. All 
      children attending the fifth grade of Teutônia, Brazil, were invited to 
      participate in the study. Only schoolchildren who did not report back pain were 
      included in the first assessment. The schoolchildren completed the Back Pain and 
      Body Posture Evaluation Instrument (BackPEI) during three assessments (2011, 
      2014, and 2017). BackPEI assesses the presence of back pain and possible 
      associated risk factors (postural, behavioral, and sociodemographic). Generalized 
      estimated equations (GEE) were used to perform a Poisson regression model with 
      robust variance for longitudinal analysis. After six years of follow-up, 75 
      schoolchildren completed all the assessments. The risk factors associated with 
      back pain were spending more than six hours daily watching television, lifting 
      objects from the ground adopting an inadequate posture, using another backpack 
      type different from those with two straps, and carrying a backpack in an 
      asymmetric way. These results are important in guiding the planning of public 
      policies to minimize this public health problem.

LID - 10.1016/j.jcm.2021.12.004 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to estimate the prevalence of adolescent 
      idiopathic scoliosis (AIS), and back pain and its risk factors, in schoolchildren 
      from the semiarid region of Brazil. METHODS: A total of 520 adolescents aged 10 
      to 16 years old were assessed. The students were administered the self-reported 
      Back Pain and Body Posture Evaluation Instrument questionnaire. The screening for 
      AIS included measuring the angle of trunk rotation using a scoliometer in the 
      Adams forward-bend test. Participants with an angle of trunk rotation ≥ 7° were 
      referred for radiography. The prevalence ratio was estimated by multivariable 
      analysis using a Poisson regression model (α = 0.05). RESULTS: Among the 
      participants, 3.1% (95% confidence interval, 3.2%-6.9%) had a confirmed AIS 
      diagnosis: 1.9% girls and 1.1% boys. There was no difference between boys and 
      girls in AIS prevalence. The prevalence of back pain in the previous 3 months was 
      63.7% (95% confidence interval, 59.5%-67.7%), at a moderate level (visual analog 
      scale = 3.83; 95% confidence interval, 3.57-4.08). Multivariable analysis showed 
      that back pain is associated with postural variables, sex, and age. CONCLUSION: 
      The prevalence of AIS in the semiarid region of Brazil was 3.1%, and that of back 
      pain was 63.7%. Only body mass index was different between adolescents with and 
      without AIS, with those with AIS having a lower mean body mass index. Back pain 
      was higher in girls and increased in older adolescents. Furthermore, behavioral 
      and postural habits and hereditary factors were associated with an increased 
      chance of back pain.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Physical exercise improves physical fitness and health, helping to 
      reduce pain and prevent low back pain. This study aims to compare the intensity 
      of low back pain (LBP), behavioral habits, and the level of disability and 
      kinesiophobia among exercising and non-exercising subjects with LBP. METHODS: 
      Consecutive sample of 102 individuals was divided into exercising group (EG) and 
      non-exercising group (NEG). The data was extracted from the answers to the 
      questionnaires Back Pain and Body Posture Evaluation Instrument (BackPEI-A), 
      Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and Fear-avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire 
      (FABQ-Brazil). For statistical analysis, the chi-square test was used, α ≤ 0.05. 
      RESULTS: Both groups presented predominance of mild to moderate pain intensity 
      and absence of kinesiophobia in the practice of physical activity, with no 
      statistically significant difference. However, there was significant difference 
      between the groups for the risk of occurrence of LBP and for levels of incapacity 
      and kinesiophobia related to work. CONCLUSION: Exercising individuals appear to 
      present with a lower risk for occurrence of LBP, lower level of disability, and 
      absence of work-related kinesiophobia.

TI  - Evaluation of functional outcomes following rectus diastasis repair-an up-to-date 
      literature review.
PG  - 905-914
LID - 10.1007/s10029-021-02462-0 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Over the last decade rectus diastasis has gained attention as a 
      condition that may benefit from surgery. Numerous surgical techniques have been 
      presented but scientifically proper studies reporting functional outcome are few 
      and evidence is incomplete. The aim of this up-to-date review is to analyse the 
      outcomes of rectus diastasis repair in recently published papers, focusing on 
      functional changes following surgery. METHOD: A comprehensive search in PubMed 
      and Web of Science was performed. Suitable papers were selected using titles and 
      abstracts with terms suggesting surgical treatment of rectus diastasis. All 
      abstracts were scrutinised, and irrelevant studies excluded in four stages. 
      Reports providing original data, including outcome assessment following surgery, 
      were included. RESULT: Ten papers with a total of 780 patients were found to 
      fulfil the search criteria. Study design, surgical procedure, follow-up time, 
      functional outcome and assessment instruments were compiled. All included studies 
      reported improvements in a variety of functional aspects regardless of surgical 
      method. The outcomes assessed include core stability, back pain, abdominal pain, 
      posture, urinary incontinence, abdominal muscle strength and quality of life. 
      CONCLUSION: The results of this review show that surgical repair of rectus 
      diastasis is a safe and effective treatment that improves functional disability. 
      However, the absence of standardized instruments for assessing outcome makes it 
      impossible to compare studies. Since indications for surgery are relative and 
      related to core function, valid instruments for assessing indication and outcome 
      are needed to ensure benefit of the procedure.

TI  - The effect of changing movement and posture using motion-sensor biofeedback, 
      versus guidelines-based care, on the clinical outcomes of people with sub-acute 
      or chronic low back pain-a multicentre, cluster-randomised, placebo-controlled, 
      pilot trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The aims of this pilot trial were to (i) test the hypothesis that 
      modifying patterns of painful lumbo-pelvic movement using motion-sensor 
      biofeedback in people with low back pain would lead to reduced pain and activity 
      limitation compared with guidelines-based care, and (ii) facilitate sample size 
      calculations for a fully powered trial. METHODS: A multicentre (8 clinics), 
      cluster-randomised, placebo-controlled pilot trial compared two groups of 
      patients seeking medical or physiotherapy primary care for sub-acute and chronic 
      back pain. It was powered for longitudinal analysis, but not for adjusted 
      single-time point comparisons. The intervention group (n = 58) received 
      modification of movement patterns augmented by motion-sensor movement biofeedback 
      (ViMove, dorsaVi.com) plus guidelines-based medical or physiotherapy care. The 
      control group (n = 54) received a placebo (wearing the motion-sensors without 
      biofeedback) plus guidelines-based medical or physiotherapy care. Primary 
      outcomes were self-reported pain intensity (VAS) and activity limitation (Roland 
      Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ), Patient Specific Functional Scale 
      (PSFS)), all on 0-100 scales. Both groups received 6-8 treatment sessions. 
      Outcomes were measured seven times during 10-weeks of treatment and at 12, 26 and 
      52 week follow-up, with 17.0 % dropout. Patients were not informed of group 
      allocation or the study hypothesis. RESULTS: Across one-year, there were 
      significant between-group differences favouring the intervention group 
      [generalized linear model coefficient (95 % CI): group effect RMDQ -7.1 (95 % 
      CI-12.6;-1.6), PSFS -10.3 (-16.6; -3.9), QVAS -7.7 (-13.0; -2.4); and group by 
      time effect differences (per 100 days) RMDQ -3.5 (-5.2; -2.2), PSFS -4.7 (-7.0; 
      -2.5), QVAS -4.8 (-6.1; -3.5)], all p < 0.001. Risk ratios between groups of 
      probability of improving by >30 % at 12-months = RMDQ 2.4 (95 % CI 1.5; 4.1), 
      PSFS 2.5 (1.5; 4.0), QVAS 3.3 (1.8; 5.9). The only device-related side-effects 
      involved transient skin irritation from tape used to mount motion sensors. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Individualised movement retraining using motion-sensor biofeedback 
      resulted in significant and sustained improvements in pain and activity 
      limitation that persisted after treatment finished. This pilot trial also refined 
      the procedures and sample size requirements for a fully powered RCT. This trial 
      (Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry NCT01572779) was equally funded 
      by dorsaVi P/L and the Victorian State Government.

TI  - Association of postural education and postural hygiene with low back pain in 
      schoolchildren: Cross-sectional results from the PEPE study.
PG  - 157-165
LID - 10.34172/hpp.2023.19 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Low back pain (LBP) is the leading cause of disability in the world 
      that affects the population of all ages globally. The main aim of the present 
      study was to analyze the cross-sectional association of postural education and 
      postural hygiene habits with LBP, differentiating between frequency and intensity 
      of pain. METHODS: This cross-sectional study assessed 849 students aged 10-12 
      years from primary schools. The study was based on four different structured and 
      self-administered questionnaires: back pain questionnaire, Back Pain and Body 
      Posture Evaluation Instrument (BackPEI), Frequency of Commuting to and from 
      School Questionnaire, and the Hebacaknow questionnaire. In addition, height and 
      weight were included to determine the body mass index (BMI). RESULTS: 
      Participants with prevalence of LBP were significantly older (P=0.038), girls 
      (P<0.001), taller (P=0.018), and practice active travelled back from school 
      (P=0.016). Otherwise, participants with no prevalence of LBP sat correctly at the 
      desk (P<0.001). Higher knowledge of postural education was associated with lower 
      intensity of LBP (β=-0.07, CI=-0.12 - -0.02, P=0.004). CONCLUSION: The knowledge 
      related to postural education it is associated with less LBP. School 
      interventions improving knowledge about postural education, ergonomics and 
      postural hygiene are needed to address this important matter.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify the prevalence of back pain among Brazilian school 
      children and the factors associated with this pain. METHODS: All 1,720 
      schoolchildren from the fifth to the eight grade attending schools from the city 
      of Teutonia, RS, Southern Brazil, were invited to participate in the study. From 
      these, 1,597 children participated. We applied the Back Pain and Body Posture 
      Evaluation Instrument. The dependent variable was back pain, while the 
      independent one were demographic, socioeconomic, behavior and heredity data. The 
      prevalence ratio was estimated by multivariate analysis using the Poisson 
      regression model (α = 0.05). RESULTS: The prevalence of back pain in the last 
      three months was 55.7% (n = 802). The multivariate analysis showed that back pain 
      is associated with the variables: sex, parents with back pain, weekly frequency 
      of physical activity, daily time spent watching television, studying in bed, 
      sitting posture to write and use the computer, and way of carrying the backpack. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of back pain in schoolchildren is high and it is 
      associated with demographic, behavior and heredity aspects.

TI  - Management of iatrogenic flat-back syndrome.
PG  - E8
AB  - Iatrogenic loss of lordosis is now frequently recognized as a complication 
      following placement of thoracolumbar instrumentation, especially with distraction 
      instrumentation. Flat-back syndrome is characterized by forward inclination of 
      the trunk, inability to stand upright, and back pain. Evaluation of the deformity 
      should include a full-length lateral radiograph obtained with the patient's knees 
      and hips fully extended. The most common cause of the deformity includes the use 
      of distraction instrumentation in the lumbar spine and pseudarthrosis. Surgical 
      treatment described in the literature includes opening (Smith-Petersen) 
      osteotomy, polysegmental osteotomy, and closing wedge osteotomy. The authors will 
      review the literature, cause, clinical presentation, prevention, and surgical 
      management of flat-back syndrome.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The present study aims to determine the time spent in different 
      static trunk postures during a typical working day of workers in a special school 
      for the severe handicaps. METHODS: Eighteen workers with low back pain (LBP) and 
      fifteen asymptomatic workers were recruited. A cross-sectional design was 
      employed to study the time spent in different static trunk postures which was 
      recorded by a biaxial accelerometer attached to the T12 level of the back of the 
      subjects. RESULTS: The results of ANCOVA revealed that subjects with LBP spent 
      significantly longer percentage of time in static trunk posture when compared to 
      normal (p < 0.05). It was also shown that they spent significantly longer time in 
      trunk flexion for more than 10 degrees (p < 0.0125). CONCLUSION: An innovative 
      method has been developed for continuous tracking of spinal posture, and this has 
      potential for widespread applications in the workplace. The findings of the 
      present investigation suggest that teachers in special schools are at increased 
      risk of getting LBP. In order to minimise such risk, frequent postural change and 
      awareness of work posture are recommended.

TI  - Teaching Back Health in the School Setting: A Systematic Review of Randomized 
      Controlled Trials.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph18030979 [doi]
LID - 979
AB  - School-based interventions have reported effectiveness on back health; however, 
      there are no specific guidelines for teaching body mechanics and posture in 
      primary and secondary schools. To identify, describe, and analyze the educative 
      features of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on back health developed to date 
      in the school setting, a systematic review was performed following the preferred 
      reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) 
      recommendations. RCTs exclusively focused on educational setting electronic 
      databases included PubMed, EMBASE, PEDro, Web of Science, SPORTDiscus, ERIC, and 
      MEDLINE on the Ovid platform. Databases were searched for potentially eligible 
      studies from the earliest date up to 18th March 2020. A total of 584 records were 
      obtained from the database searches. A total of six articles that applied 
      inclusion criteria were assessed for eligibility. All of these studies found 
      improvements in postural habits and the level of knowledge with regard to back 
      health, as well as a reduction in the prevalence of back pain. None of the 
      studies used the student-centered method, and three studies used evaluation 
      instruments with a pilot validation. Research on RCT interventions concerning 
      back health in the school setting is scarce. None of the interventions applied a 
      constructivist or student-centered method. The use of validated and standardized 
      assessment instruments is required.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Low back pain (LBP) is responsible for the highest number of years 
      lived with disability globally. There is a paucity of data regarding the same 
      among medical students. So, this study was planned to estimate the prevalence of 
      acute LBP having a high propensity to develop into chronic one as well as to 
      determine associated correlates among medical students. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
      This cross-sectional study was conducted among 300 medical students at a tertiary 
      hospital using an Acute Low Back Pain Screening Questionnaire (ALBPSQ) to 
      identify individuals with LBP and having a high risk of developing a long-term 
      disability. ALBPSQ is a 21-question-based biopsychosocial screening instrument 
      for identifying patients at risk of chronicity. ALBPSQ scores have been found to 
      be significantly associated with pain and functional disability. Descriptive 
      statistics, bivariate analysis, and multiple binary logistic regression have been 
      performed through SPSS-22 software. RESULTS: The prevalence of LBP having the 
      propensity to develop into a long-term disability was found to be 14.3% (95% CI: 
      10.6-18.8). In bivariate analysis, higher age, no exercise, higher screen time, 
      mental stress, studying in bed, abnormal posture, alcohol intake, tobacco use, 
      positive family history, greater screen time per day, and more time spent in a 
      sitting posture are significant with LBP. Stress ((adjusted odds ratio) AOR: 
      4.37, 95% CI: 1.79-10.68)), abnormally bent standing posture (AOR: 3.6, 95% CI: 
      1.3-10.6), and positive family of LBP (AOR: 3.6, 95% CI: 1.3-10.1) were found to 
      be independent predictors of LBP among medical students. CONCLUSION: Among 
      medical students, every 15 out of 100 have a low back problem with chances of 
      long-term disability. These students require early intervention to avoid 
      long-term disability. Abnormal stooping posture, psychological stress, and 
      positive family history of low pain might independently lead to LBP.

LID - 10.1007/s10484-020-09457-0 [doi]
AB  - Collapsed or slouching posture has been associated with negative health outcomes 
      such as pain, depression, and overall stress ratings as well as declines in 
      general health, emotional well-being, and energy/fatigue levels. Currently, 
      wearable devices and accompanying smartphone applications (apps) can provide 
      feedback about shifting posture (e.g., erect vs. collapsed or slouching 
      positions), as well as provide suggestions that support positive posture 
      awareness. This study investigates the effect of a wearable 'UpRight' 
      posture-feedback device on self-reports of pain, mood, and performance in 
      comparison to a non-treatment control group. 56 Student participants filled out 
      the SF-36 RAND Health Survey at the beginning and end of the 4-week study. The 
      treatment group (n = 13) used a wearable device for at least 15 min per day, for 
      4 weeks, while a matched comparison group (n = 13) participated without the 
      device over the same period. Evaluations before and after the 4 weeks included 
      the SF-36, as well as qualitative descriptions of their experiences. The 
      treatment group significantly improved on the SF-36 measures of physical 
      functioning, emotions, energy/fatigue, confidence and overall stress ratings, as 
      well as on subjective ratings of neck and back posture as compared to the control 
      group. The wearable biofeedback device positively influenced awareness of neck 
      and back posture, as well as key measures on the RAND SF-36 Health Survey. This 
      study provides preliminary support that a wearable posture feedback device is a 
      useful tool to teach posture awareness and improve well-being.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Some health problems can be associated with the school environment 
      and lifestyles, so it is necessary to carry out intervention actions that promote 
      health and problem prevention. This study evaluates the effects of a Back School 
      and Postural Education on improving short-term and long-term ergonomic knowledge 
      of postures adopted at school and home, as well as reducing low back pain (LBP) 
      in adolescents. METHODS: The sample comprises 98 students, aged 10-16 years 
      (11.61 ± 1.28 years), with 63 (64.3%) girls. The measuring instruments included a 
      theoretical and a practical test, a low back pain (LBP) questionnaire and a 
      scale. The tests and the scale have been applied 1 week before the intervention, 
      1 week following the Back School and Postural Education Program, and a 1 year 
      later. The questionnaire was applied 1 week before of intervention and after 1 
      year. The intervention included three sessions of a theoretical and practical 
      nature, each lasting 45 min, with intervals of 1 week. RESULTS: The values of the 
      theoretical test before the intervention, 1 week, and 1 year after the 
      intervention were, respectively, 8.67 ± 2.64, 11.37 ± 1.93, and 11.11 ± 1.92 
      (p ≤ 0.001), and the practical test were 6.42 ± 2.47, 12.48 ± 2.25, and 
      12.83 ± 1.78 (p ≤ 0.001). The presence of LBP fell by 42.9%-25.5% after the 
      1-year period. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show an improvement of ergonomic knowledge 
      of postures adopted at school and home as a result of the education program and a 
      decrease of self-reported LBP.

TI  - Measuring lumbar reposition accuracy in patients with unspecific low back pain: 
      systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - E97-E111
LID - 10.1097/BRS.0000000000000677 [doi]
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate if 
      patients with nonspecific chronic low back pain (NSCLBP) show a greater lumbar 
      reposition error (RE) than healthy controls. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Studies 
      on lumbar RE in patients with NSCLBP present conflicting results. METHODS: A 
      systematic review and meta-analysis of the available literature were performed to 
      evaluate differences in RE between patients with NSCLBP and healthy controls. 
      Data on absolute error, constant error (CE), and variable error were extracted 
      and effect sizes (ESs) were calculated. For the CE flexion pattern and active 
      extension pattern, subgroups of patients with NSCLBP were analyzed. Results of 
      homogeneous studies were pooled. Measurement protocols and study outcomes were 
      compared. The quality of reporting and the authors' appraisal of risk of bias 
      were investigated. RESULTS: The original search revealed 178 records of which 13 
      fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The majority of studies showed that patients 
      with NSCLBP produced a significantly larger absolute error (ES, 0.81; 95% 
      confidence interval [95% CI], 0.13-1.49) and variable error (ES, 0.57; 95% CI, 
      0.05-1.09) compared with controls. CE is direction specific in flexion and active 
      extension pattern subgroups of patients with NSCLBP (ES, 0.39; 95% CI, -1.09 to 
      0.3) and ES, 0.18; 95% CI, -0.3 to 0.65, respectively). The quality of reporting 
      and the authors' appraisal of risk of bias varied considerably. The applied test 
      procedures and instrumentation varied between the studies, which hampered the 
      comparability of studies. CONCLUSION: Although patients with NSCLBP seemed to 
      produce a larger lumbar RE compared with healthy controls, study limitations 
      render firm conclusions unsafe. Future studies should pay closer attention to 
      power, precision, and reliability of the measurement approach, definition of 
      outcome measures, and patient selection. We recommend a large, well-powered, 
      prospective randomized control study that uses a standardized measurement 
      approach and definitions for absolute error, CE, and variable error to address 
      the hypothesis that proprioception may be impaired with CLBP.

TI  - Development and psychometric evaluation of a health questionnaire on back care 
      knowledge in daily life physical activities for adolescent students.
PG  - 2803-8
LID - 10.1007/s00586-016-4627-9 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The most relevant musculoskeletal problems are related with back health. 
      Study instruments have been designed for adult patient population but not for 
      school-aged children. The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate the 
      psychometric properties of a questionnaire to assess adolescents' level of back 
      care knowledge in daily life physical activities. METHODS: Participants were 171 
      adolescents from secondary schools. The questionnaire was made up of 24 
      questions. A Delphi method was used for test validation. Cronbach's alpha, 
      test-retest, Wilcoxon signed-rank and Bland-Altman graph were used to evaluate 
      the instrument reliability. RESULTS: Cronbach's alpha (α = 0.82) showed a strong 
      internal consistency. Test-retest was excellent for total score (0.76) and 
      moderate to excellent (0.54-0.76) for seven score conceptual categories with good 
      results of standard error of the mean and minimal detectable change. No 
      differences were found between test 1 and test 2 except for the standing posture 
      scores. CONCLUSION: The questionnaire showed acceptable psychometric values. 
      Results showed that this questionnaire is a good instrument to assess 
      adolescent's back care knowledge.

      pain: A systematic review and selection of instruments.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Observing and analyzing movement quality (MQ) in patients with 
      non-specific low back pain (NS-LBP) is important in the clinical reasoning of 
      primary care physiotherapists and exercise therapists. However, there is no 
      standardized form of assessment. RESEARCH QUESTION: which MQ domains are measured 
      with which instruments, and which activities are relevant, appropriate and 
      methodologically sound for assessing MQ in patients with NS-LBP? METHODS: The 
      study had three phases. In phase 1 we conducted a systematic review in PubMed, 
      CINAHL and SPORTDiscus of literature published until October 2018. The selected 
      studies measured MQ domains with instruments that enabled us to 1) compare MQ in 
      self-paced dynamic activities of patients with NS-LBP and healthy controls, 
      and/or 2) determine change over time of MQ in patients with NS-LBP. In phase 2 we 
      established relevant dynamic activities to assess in patients with NS-LBP. In 
      phase 3 we determined appropriateness and methodological qualities of the 
      selected instruments. RESULTS: Thirty cross-sectional and three pre-post-test 
      studies were eligible. The instruments consisted of complex (n = 19) and simple 
      (n = 7) instrumented motion analysis systems and standardized observational tests 
      (n = 7). We identified three domains representative for MQ: range of motion 
      (ROM), inter-segmental coordination, and whole-body movements. In these domains, 
      patients with NS-LBP significantly differed from healthy controls, respectively 
      7/12, 12/13 and 13/20 studies. Moreover, ROM and whole-body movements 
      significantly improved over time in patients with NS-LBP (3/3 studies). Based on 
      phase 3, we concluded that none of the instruments are appropriate to assess MQ 
      in patients with NS-LBP in primary care. SIGNIFICANCE: Forward bending, lifting, 
      and walking seem the most relevant activities to evaluate in patients with 
      NS-LBP. However, we found no suitable instruments to measure ROM, inter-segmental 
      coordination, or whole-body movements as determinants of MQ in these activities 
      in daily practice. We therefore recommend such an instrument be developed.

AB  - Spinal loads are recognized to play a causative role in back disorders and pain. 
      Knowledge of lumbar spinal loads is required in proper management of various 
      spinal disorders, effective risk prevention and assessment in the workplace, 
      sports and rehabilitation, realistic testing of spinal implants as well as 
      adequate loading in in vitro studies. During the last few decades, researchers 
      have used a number of techniques to estimate spinal loads by measuring in vivo 
      changes in the intradiscal pressure, body height, or forces and moments 
      transmitted via instrumented vertebral implants. In parallel, computational 
      models have been employed to estimate muscle forces and spinal loads under 
      various static and dynamic conditions. Noteworthy is the increasing growth in 
      latter computational investigations. This paper aims to review, compare and 
      critically evaluate the existing literature on in vivo measurements and 
      computational model studies of lumbar spinal loads to lay the foundation for 
      future biomechanical studies. Towards this goal, the paper reviews in separate 
      sections models dealing with static postures (standing, sitting, lying) as well 
      as slow and fast dynamic activities (lifting, sudden perturbations and 
      vibrations). The findings are helpful in many areas such as work place safety 
      design and ergonomics, injury prevention, performance enhancement, implant design 
      and rehabilitation management.

AB  - We studied 8 patients with spinal cord stimulation (SCS) devices which had been 
      previously implanted to treat neuropathic chronic pain secondary to Failed Back 
      Surgery Syndrome. The aim of our study was to investigate the effects of SCS on 
      posture and gait by means of clinical scales (Short Form Health Survey-36, Visual 
      Analogue Scale for pain, and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale) and instrumented 
      evaluation with 3D Gait Analysis using a stereophotogrammetric system. The latter 
      was performed with the SCS device turned both OFF and ON. We recorded gait and 
      posture using the Davis protocol and also trunk movement during flexion-extension 
      on the sagittal plane, lateral bending on the frontal plane, and rotation on the 
      transversal plane. During and 30 minutes after the stimulation, not only the 
      clinical scales but also spatial-temporal gait parameters and trunk movements 
      improved significantly. Improvement was not shown under stimulation-OFF 
      conditions. Our preliminary data suggest that SCS has the potential to improve 
      posture and gait and to provide a window of pain-free opportunity to optimize 
      rehabilitation interventions.

TI  - Machine Learning Identifies Chronic Low Back Pain Patients from an Instrumented 
      Trunk Bending and Return Test.
LID - 10.3390/s22135027 [doi]
LID - 5027
AB  - Nowadays, the better assessment of low back pain (LBP) is an important challenge, 
      as it is the leading musculoskeletal condition worldwide in terms of years of 
      disability. The objective of this study was to evaluate the relevance of various 
      machine learning (ML) algorithms and Sample Entropy (SampEn), which assesses the 
      complexity of motion variability in identifying the condition of low back pain. 
      Twenty chronic low-back pain (CLBP) patients and 20 healthy non-LBP participants 
      performed 1-min repetitive bending (flexion) and return (extension) trunk 
      movements. Analysis was performed using the time series recorded by three 
      inertial sensors attached to the participants. It was found that SampEn was 
      significantly lower in CLBP patients, indicating a loss of movement complexity 
      due to LBP. Gaussian Naive Bayes ML proved to be the best of the various tested 
      algorithms, achieving 79% accuracy in identifying CLBP patients. Angular velocity 
      of flexion movement was the most discriminative feature in the ML analysis. This 
      study demonstrated that: supervised ML and a complexity assessment of trunk 
      movement variability are useful in the identification of CLBP condition, and that 
      simple kinematic indicators are sensitive to this condition. Therefore, ML could 
      be progressively adopted by clinicians in the assessment of CLBP patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim was to construct and validate a gender-specific job exposure 
      matrix (JEM) for physical exposures to be used in epidemiological studies of low 
      back pain (LBP). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We utilized two large Finnish population 
      surveys, one to construct the JEM and another to test matrix validity. The 
      exposure axis of the matrix included exposures relevant to LBP (heavy physical 
      work, heavy lifting, awkward trunk posture and whole body vibration) and 
      exposures that increase the biomechanical load on the low back (arm elevation) or 
      those that in combination with other known risk factors could be related to LBP 
      (kneeling or squatting). Job titles with similar work tasks and exposures were 
      grouped. Exposure information was based on face-to-face interviews. Validity of 
      the matrix was explored by comparing the JEM (group-based) binary measures with 
      individual-based measures. The predictive validity of the matrix against LBP was 
      evaluated by comparing the associations of the group-based (JEM) exposures with 
      those of individual-based exposures. RESULTS: The matrix includes 348 job titles, 
      representing 81% of all Finnish job titles in the early 2000s. The specificity of 
      the constructed matrix was good, especially in women. The validity measured with 
      kappa-statistic ranged from good to poor, being fair for most exposures. In men, 
      all group-based (JEM) exposures were statistically significantly associated with 
      one-month prevalence of LBP. In women, four out of six group-based exposures 
      showed an association with LBP. CONCLUSIONS: The gender-specific JEM for physical 
      exposures showed relatively high specificity without compromising sensitivity. 
      The matrix can therefore be considered as a valid instrument for exposure 
      assessment in large-scale epidemiological studies, when more precise but more 
      labour-intensive methods are not feasible. Although the matrix was based on 
      Finnish data we foresee that it could be applicable, with some modifications, in 
      other countries with a similar level of technology.

TI  - Relevance of adding a triangular dynamic cushion on a traditional chair: A 
      3D-analysis of seated schoolchildren.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Low back pain is highly prevalent in the general population and is 
      even reported as early as at primary school. A poor sitting position has been 
      suggested as an etiologic factor. This study analysed, in primary schoolchildren, 
      the influence of a triangular dynamic cushion that aims to help children maintain 
      their physiological lumbar lordosis and to induce movement to reduce the static 
      effect of the sitting position. METHODS: Thirty 8-year-old children took part in 
      this study. A 3D analysis combined with electromyography was used to evaluate the 
      biomechanics and the related muscle activation in two sitting positions (with and 
      without a triangular cushion on a horizontal stool) during a 15-minute working 
      task. In addition, the force of the feet on the ground was assessed with a force 
      plate. FINDINGS: The cushion improved the trunk-thighs angle, lumbar lordosis, 
      anterior pelvis tilt, and feet support on the ground (p<0.0001). In addition, 
      sitting on the cushion appeared to be more dynamic (p<0.05) and induced a 
      decrease of the lumbar paravertebral muscle activity (p<0.01). INTERPRETATION: 
      Sitting on a dynamic triangular cushion tends to favour the "ideal" siting 
      position usually described in the literature and to decrease the level of 
      paravertebral muscle recruitment. Seeing that sitting position is a risk factor 
      to develop low back pain, the cushion could be a solution to prevent it.

TI  - Motor Control Training for the Shoulder with Smart Garments.
LID - 10.3390/s17071687 [doi]
LID - 1687
AB  - Wearable technologies for posture monitoring and posture correction are emerging 
      as a way to support and enhance physical therapy treatment, e.g., for motor 
      control training in neurological disorders or for treating musculoskeletal 
      disorders, such as shoulder, neck, or lower back pain. Among the various 
      technological options for posture monitoring, wearable systems offer potential 
      advantages regarding mobility, use in different contexts and sustained tracking 
      in daily life. We describe the design of a smart garment named Zishi to monitor 
      compensatory movements and evaluate its applicability for shoulder motor control 
      training in a clinical setting. Five physiotherapists and eight patients with 
      musculoskeletal shoulder pain participated in the study. The attitudes of 
      patients and therapists towards the system were measured using standardized 
      survey instruments. The results indicate that patients and their therapists 
      consider Zishi a credible aid for rehabilitation and patients expect it will help 
      towards their recovery. The system was perceived as highly usable and patients 
      were motivated to train with the system. Future research efforts on the 
      improvement of the customization of feedback location and modality, and on the 
      evaluation of Zishi as support for motor learning in shoulder patients, should be 
      made.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) are a severe occupational health 
      issue among medical radiation practitioners. It is mostly linked to personal 
      protective wear, working posture, tools employed and ergonomics. OBJECTIVE: To 
      assess and evaluate the musculoskeletal disorders among nuclear medicine 
      professionals (NMP) in India. METHODS: An online survey was distributed to 455 
      NMP throughout India between November 2021 and March 2022 covering the 
      demographic characteristics and questions for evaluation of musculoskeletal 
      symptoms using the Standardized Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire (NMQ). 
      Participants with any pre-existing musculoskeletal disorder or trauma were 
      excluded. Descriptive statistics summarized the data from the demographics, 
      discomfort, aches and work-related musculoskeletal injuries. Chi-square test was 
      used to examine the association between the obtained values. RESULTS: 91 out of 
      124 respondents were included based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. 
      Results shows that there is a significant association between the height of the 
      individual and neck pain, body mass index and elbows pain, age and low back pain, 
      experience in the current work and upper back pain, the weight of the individual 
      and knee pain, use of mobile lead screens and shoulder pain, use of gonad shield, 
      trouble in the ankles and use of lead screens, and QC phantoms for gamma camera / 
      PET and wrists/hands pain. CONCLUSION: Work-related musculoskeletal disorders 
      among NMP are resulting from factors of individual demographic variables (such as 
      age, height, weight, body mass index), years of experience at the current 
      workplace and of using instruments in their work area.

TI  - Establishment of a bipedal rat model of lumbar facet joint osteoarthritis using 
      intraarticular injection of urinary plasminogen activator.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies have demonstrated that by injecting uPA into the 
      lumbar facet joints (LFJ) of normal rats, a rat LFJOA animal model can be 
      successfully established. However, there is no evidence that intraarticular 
      injection of uPA can induce or much serious osteoarthritis in bipedal rats, which 
      biomechanics is much more similar to human than normal rats. To investigate 
      whether intraarticular injection of urinary plasminogen activator (uPA) can 
      induce LFJOA and low back pain symptoms in bipedal rats. METHODS: An experimental 
      study on the construction of a modified animal model of lumbar facet joints 
      osteoarthritis (LFJOA) which biomechanics is similar to human. Sprague-Dawley 
      rats were treated with intraarticular injection of uPA in the L5-L6 facet joints 
      (uPA group, n = 15) or saline (saline group, n = 15). The forelimbs of both two 
      group rats were amputated. Mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia in the ipsilateral 
      hind paws were evaluated using von Frey hairs and a thermoalgesia instrument, 
      respectively. Toluidine blue staining, hematoxylin-eosin staining, and 
      immunohistochemical examination of the LFJ was performed. RESULTS: The saline 
      group rats have not demonstrated significant osteoarthritis in rats LFJ after 
      surgery. The uPA group has not been induced significantly higher mechanical and 
      thermal hyperalgesia in comparison with the saline group. But intraarticular 
      injection of uPA in biped rats induced significantly stronger articular cartilage 
      damage, synovitis, and proliferation of synovial cells in the LFJ. Inflammatory 
      factors such as iNOS, IL-1β, and TNF-a were more significantly expressed in 
      bipedal rat injected with uPA (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Intraarticular injection 
      of uPA can induce LFJOA in bipedal rats, while upright posture does not induce 
      osteoarthritis in rats LFJ in the short term.

TI  - Self-reported back pain in tractor drivers exposed to whole-body vibration.
PG  - 109-15
AB  - A postal questionnaire on symptoms of ill health and exposure to whole-body 
      vibration was completed by 577 workers (response rate 79%) who were employed in 
      certain functions by two companies 11 years before. The relation between the 
      occupational history of driving vibrating vehicles (mainly agricultural tractors) 
      and back pain has been analyzed. The prevalence of reported back pain is 
      approximately 10% higher in the tractor drivers than in workers not exposed to 
      vibration. The increase is mainly due to more pain in the lower back and more 
      pain lasting at least several days. A vibration dose was calculated by assigning 
      each vehicle driven a vibration magnitude, estimated on the base of vibration 
      measurements. The prevalence of back pain increases with the vibration dose. The 
      highest prevalence odds ratios are found for the more severe types of back pain. 
      These prevalence odds ratios do not increase with the vibration dose. This might 
      be due to health-related selection which is more pronounced for severe back pain 
      than for back pain in general. The two components of the vibration dose, duration 
      of exposure and estimated mean vibration magnitude, have also been considered 
      separately. Back pain increases with duration of exposure but it does not 
      increase with the estimated mean magnitude of vibration. This is probably due to 
      the inaccuracy of this estimate. The higher prevalence of back pain in tractor 
      drivers might be (partly) caused by whole-body vibration, but prolonged sitting 
      and posture might also be of influence.

TI  - Successful management of iliocostal impingement syndrome: A case series.
PG  - 384-7
LID - 10.1177/0309364615605394 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Iliocostal impingement syndrome is a rare, painful, and disabling 
      condition associated with thoracic hyperkyphosis and kyphoscoliosis. There is 
      little published literature regarding management of this syndrome. The purpose of 
      this case series is to report treatment outcomes for iliocostal impingement 
      syndrome with improving posture and back muscle strength. CASE DESCRIPTION AND 
      METHODS: Thirty-eight women with thoracic hyperkyphosis or kyphoscoliosis and 
      back and/or flank pain were diagnosed with iliocostal impingement syndrome on the 
      basis of symptoms and spine radiographs. They were instructed in weighted 
      kypho-orthosis use and taught a home back-extensor strengthening program. Outcome 
      measures included posture evaluation and pain level. FINDINGS AND OUTCOMES: All 
      patients reported immediate pain reduction with weighted kypho-orthosis trial. 
      Nineteen patients returned within 2 years, and all had continued pain relief and 
      posture improvement. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that successful management 
      of iliocostal impingement syndrome is possible with a weighted kypho-orthosis and 
      back strengthening program focusing on posture improvement. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: 
      Iliocostal syndrome is a rare, painful, and disabling condition that severely 
      affects quality of life. This report discusses our diagnostic and treatment 
      approach to this syndrome, which has proven successful in our patient population.

TI  - What do physiotherapists and manual handling advisors consider the safest lifting 
      posture, and do back beliefs influence their choice?
PG  - 35-40
LID - S2468-7812(17)30159-5 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.msksp.2017.10.010 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: It is commonly believed lifting is dangerous and the back should be 
      straight during lifting. These beliefs may arise from healthcare professionals, 
      yet no study has evaluated the lifting and back beliefs of manual handling 
      advisors (MHAs) and physiotherapists (PTs). OBJECTIVES: To evaluate (i) what 
      lifting technique MHAs and PTs perceive as safest, and why, and (ii) the back 
      pain beliefs of MHAs and PTs. DESIGN: Data was collected via an electronic 
      survey. METHOD: Participants selected the safest lifting posture from four 
      options: two with a straight back and two with a more rounded back, with 
      justification. Back beliefs were collected via the Back-Pain Attitudes 
      Questionnaire (Back-PAQ). Relationships were investigated using multiple linear 
      and logistic regression models. RESULTS: 400 PTs and MHAs completed the survey. 
      75% of PTs and 91% of MHAs chose a straight lifting posture as safest, mostly on 
      the basis that it avoided rounding of the back. MHAs scored significantly higher 
      than PTs on the Back-PAQ instrument (mean difference = 33.9), indicating more 
      negative back beliefs. Those who chose the straight back position had 
      significantly more negative back beliefs (mean 81.9, SD 22.7) than those who 
      chose a round back lift (mean 61.7, SD 21.1). CONCLUSION: Avoiding rounding the 
      back while lifting is a common belief in PTs and MHAs, despite the lack of 
      evidence that any specific spinal posture is a risk factor for low back pain. 
      MHAs, and those who perceived a straight back position as safest, had 
      significantly more negative back beliefs.

TI  - Surgical fatigue syndrome and EDiS3 intervention, should every surgeon need to 
      know how to mitigate muscle skeletal discomfort?
PG  - 184-191
LID - 10.1016/j.sopen.2023.10.014 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Surgical fatigue syndrome (SFS) is a frequent, but underestimated, 
      entity that occurs during laparoscopic surgeries. It could impair surgical 
      outcomes, patient safety, and surgeon health. Furthermore, current surgical 
      education lacks effective interventions to avoid it. Discomfort represents the 
      most common manifestation and includes musculoskeletal fatigue, numbness, or 
      frank pain. The most common affected sites are the back neck, dominant hand 
      shoulder, and high or low back. We propose an integral intervention (surgeon 
      posture, instruments/devices design & use and discomfort improvement) that 
      prevents or mitigates SFS. METHODS: An experimental study was conducted on 57 
      general surgery residents and general surgeons. Participants in the experimental 
      and control group executed standardized laparoscopic knots in a simulator and 
      knowledge, body discomfort, and posture/ergonomic risk was evaluated before and 
      after intervention application. RESULTS: A statistically significant decrease in 
      discomfort intensity was found in the experimental group. Also, discomfort 
      presentation by the anatomic site diminishes and surgical performance improves. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Intervention prevents or mitigates discomfort associated with 
      muscle-skeletal component of SFS. ACGME COMPETENCY: Practice Based-Learning and 
      Improvement.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether sacroiliac join (SIJ) pain can be secondary to 
      walking with a flexed posture resulting from stenosis with neurogenic 
      claudication, and resolves spontaneously after lumbar decompression. METHODS: A 
      review of charts from January 1, 2014, through March 3, 2019, was performed to 
      identify consecutive cases of adults 35 years of age or older with surgical 
      spinal stenosis with neurogenic claudication as well as concomitant severe SIJ 
      pain. Posture was considered flexed during walking if self-reported, confirmed by 
      a close companion, or observed directly. SIJ pain was diagnosed clinically ± 
      confirmatory injection. A 10-point visual analog scale was used to assess SIJ 
      pain. The primary endpoint was SIJ pain improvement at a minimum of 24 months' 
      follow-up. SIJ pain improvement at 3 months was used to assess the rate of 
      improvement as a secondary endpoint. RESULTS: Ten patients (3 female) met entry 
      criteria: 4 were treated with decompression alone; 6 with decompression and 
      spinal fusion. Mean SIJ visual analog scale pain score improved by 6.9 ± 2.4 (8.7 
      ± 1.6-1.8 ± 2.2; P < 0.0005). Results were similar for 20 patients at the 
      secondary endpoint of 3 months. CONCLUSIONS: Sacroiliac joint pain shows robust, 
      rapid, reliable, and durable improvement following lumbar decompressive surgery. 
      The addition of a spinal fusion also leads to a similar improvement in SIJ pain. 
      This study demonstrates the importance of evaluating the specific source of low 
      back pain in patients with stenosis, claudication, and SIJ pain so as to more 
      effectively plan appropriate surgery.

AB  - A standing computer workstation has now become a popular modern work place 
      intervention to reduce sedentary behavior at work. However, user's interaction 
      related to a standing computer workstation and its differences with a sitting 
      workstation need to be understood to assist in developing recommendations for use 
      and set up. The study compared the differences in upper extremity posture and 
      muscle activity between user-selected sitting and standing workstation setups. 
      Twenty participants (10 females, 10 males) volunteered for the study. 3-D 
      posture, surface electromyography, and user-reported discomfort were measured 
      while completing simulated tasks with each participant's self-selected 
      workstation setups. Sitting computer workstation associated with more non-neutral 
      shoulder postures and greater shoulder muscle activity, while standing computer 
      workstation induced greater wrist adduction angle and greater extensor carpi 
      radialis muscle activity. Sitting computer workstation also associated with 
      greater shoulder abduction postural variation (90th-10th percentile) while 
      standing computer workstation associated with greater variation for should 
      rotation and wrist extension. Users reported similar overall discomfort levels 
      within the first 10 min of work but had more than twice as much discomfort while 
      standing than sitting after 45 min; with most discomfort reported in the low back 
      for standing and shoulder for sitting. These different measures provide 
      understanding in users' different interactions with sitting and standing and by 
      alternating between the two configurations in short bouts may be a way of 
      changing the loading pattern on the upper extremity.

TI  - Needle gauge and tip designs for preventing post-dural puncture headache (PDPH).
PG  - CD010807
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD010807.pub2 [doi]
LID - CD010807
AB  - BACKGROUND: Post-dural puncture headache (PDPH) is one of the most common 
      complications of diagnostic and therapeutic lumbar punctures. PDPH is defined as 
      any headache occurring after a lumbar puncture that worsens within 15 minutes of 
      sitting or standing and is relieved within 15 minutes of the patient lying down. 
      Researchers have suggested many types of interventions to help prevent PDPH. It 
      has been suggested that aspects such as needle tip and gauge can be modified to 
      decrease the incidence of PDPH. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of needle tip 
      design (traumatic versus atraumatic) and diameter (gauge) on the prevention of 
      PDPH in participants who have undergone dural puncture for diagnostic or 
      therapeutic causes. SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL 
      and LILACS, as well as trial registries via the World Health Organization (WHO) 
      International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) search portal in 
      September 2016. We adopted the MEDLINE strategy for searching the other 
      databases. The search terms we used were a combination of thesaurus-based and 
      free-text terms for both interventions (lumbar puncture in neurological, 
      anaesthesia or myelography settings) and headache. SELECTION CRITERIA: We 
      included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) conducted in any clinical/research 
      setting where dural puncture had been used in participants of all ages and both 
      genders, which compared different tip designs or diameters for prevention of PDPH 
      DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used the standard methodological procedures 
      expected by Cochrane. MAIN RESULTS: We included 70 studies in the review; 66 
      studies with 17,067 participants were included in the quantitative analysis. An 
      additional 18 studies are awaiting classification and 12 are ongoing. Fifteen of 
      the 18 studies awaiting classification mainly correspond to congress summaries 
      published before 2010, in which the available information does not allow the 
      complete evaluation of all their risks of bias and characteristics. Our main 
      outcome was prevention of PDPH, but we also assessed the onset of severe PDPH, 
      headache in general and adverse events. The quality of evidence was moderate for 
      most of the outcomes mainly due to risk of bias issues. For the analysis, we 
      undertook three main comparisons: 1) traumatic needles versus atraumatic needles; 
      2) larger gauge traumatic needles versus smaller gauge traumatic needles; and 3) 
      larger gauge atraumatic needles versus smaller gauge atraumatic needles. For each 
      main comparison, if data were available, we performed a subgroup analysis 
      evaluating lumbar puncture indication, age and posture.For the first comparison, 
      the use of traumatic needles showed a higher risk of onset of PDPH compared to 
      atraumatic needles (36 studies, 9378 participants, risk ratio (RR) 2.14, 95% 
      confidence interval (CI) 1.72 to 2.67, I(2) = 9%).In the second comparison of 
      traumatic needles, studies comparing various sizes of large and small gauges 
      showed no significant difference in effects in terms of risk of PDPH, with the 
      exception of one study comparing 26 and 27 gauge needles (one study, 658 
      participants, RR 6.47, 95% CI 2.55 to 16.43).In the third comparison of 
      atraumatic needles, studies comparing various sizes of large and small gauges 
      showed no significant difference in effects in terms of risk of PDPH.We observed 
      no significant difference in the risk of paraesthesia, backache, severe PDPH and 
      any headache between traumatic and atraumatic needles. Sensitivity analyses of 
      PDPH results between traumatic and atraumatic needles omitting high risk of bias 
      studies showed similar results regarding the benefit of atraumatic needles in the 
      prevention of PDPH (three studies, RR 2.78, 95% CI 1.26 to 6.15; I(2) = 51%). 
      AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is moderate-quality evidence that atraumatic needles 
      reduce the risk of post-dural puncture headache (PDPH) without increasing adverse 
      events such as paraesthesia or backache. The studies did not report very clearly 
      on aspects related to randomization, such as random sequence generation and 
      allocation concealment, making it difficult to interpret the risk of bias in the 
      included studies. The moderate quality of the evidence for traumatic versus 
      atraumatic needles suggests that further research is likely to have an important 
      impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect.

TI  - Lumbosacral repositioning accuracy in standing posture: a combined 
      electrogoniometric and videographic evaluation.
PG  - 361-3
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To provide a new method of measuring repositioning accuracy in the 
      lumbosacral spine in a standing position. DESIGN: A test-retest and 
      parallel-forms reliability testing was performed. BACKGROUND: The contribution of 
      proprioception to lumbar muscle function and to the stability of the lumbar spine 
      is relatively unknown. METHOD: A piezoresistive electrogoniometer attached to the 
      skin over the sacrum and a three-dimensional video analysis system with 
      reflective markers on anatomical landmarks were both employed to measure the 
      repositioning accuracy of pelvic tilting in standing. Eleven subjects without low 
      back pain participated in this study. RESULTS: The overall mean repositioning 
      accuracy was 1.87 degrees. Probability values from repeated measures ANOVA 
      revealed no significant mean absolute error (AE) differences between sessions. 
      Correlation coefficients between electrogoniometer and 3-D video analysis 
      measurements of position sense ranged from 0.84 to 0.97. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      proposed instruments and method are adequate for measuring lumbosacral 
      repositioning accuracy. Healthy subjects are capable of repositioning their 
      pelvis and back precisely. RELEVANCE: A reliable method assessing the lumbosacral 
      repositioning accuracy can add insight into neuromuscular dysfunction as a cause 
      of mechanical low back pain.

TI  - Unknotting tech neck by breaking the cycle of pain and disability: Comparing the 
      impact of instrument assisted soft tissue mobilization on specific muscles and 
      superficial back arm line.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Computer professionals often develop a forward head posture due to 
      prolonged hours of computer use, leading to neck pain. Instrument-assisted soft 
      tissue mobilization (IASTM), an advanced technique for treating myofascial 
      trigger points, has become increasingly popular for addressing these 
      musculoskeletal issues. OBJECTIVES: The study aimed to compare the effectiveness 
      of IASTM mobilization on SBAL (superficial back arm line) and SM(specific 
      muscles-upper trapezius, levator scapulae, and sternocleidomastoid) in managing 
      chronic neck pain among computer professionals. PARTICIPANTS & METHODS: The study 
      involved 62 computer professionals, randomly divided into two groups. Group A 
      received IASTM on SBAL and group B received IASTM on SM for neck pain each 
      receiving three sessions weekly for four weeks. Outcome variables like Neck 
      Disability Index (NDI), NPRS(Neck Pain Rating Scale), Craniovertebral angle 
      (CVA), and range of motion (ROM) for flexion, and side flexion (right & left 
      side) were evaluated at baseline, 2 weeks and 4 weeks. RESULTS: Significant 
      improvement in NPRS were observed in both the SBAL and SM groups after 2 weeks of 
      IASTM, wth the SBAL group demonstrating greater improvement. At 4 weeks, IASTM on 
      SBAL showed significantly higher improvements in NPRS, CVA, NDI, and flexion 
      compared to the SM group. The repeated measures ANOVA indicated a significant 
      main effect of both time and group, along with a significant interaction between 
      time and group for all outcome variables, except for CVA. CONCLUSION: The study 
      indicates that IASTM on SBAL may offer a more effective treatment for chronic 
      neck pain in computer professionals compared to targeting specific muscles.

TI  - mDurance: A Novel Mobile Health System to Support Trunk Endurance Assessment.
PG  - 13159-83
LID - 10.3390/s150613159 [doi]
AB  - Low back pain is the most prevalent musculoskeletal condition. This disorder 
      constitutes one of the most common causes of disability worldwide, and as a 
      result, it has a severe socioeconomic impact. Endurance tests are normally 
      considered in low back pain rehabilitation practice to assess the muscle status. 
      However, traditional procedures to evaluate these tests suffer from practical 
      limitations, which potentially lead to inaccurate diagnoses. The use of digital 
      technologies is considered here to facilitate the task of the expert and to 
      increase the reliability and interpretability of the endurance tests. This work 
      presents mDurance, a novel mobile health system aimed at supporting specialists 
      in the functional assessment of trunk endurance by using wearable and mobile 
      devices. The system employs a wearable inertial sensor to track the patient trunk 
      posture, while portable electromyography sensors are used to seamlessly measure 
      the electrical activity produced by the trunk muscles. The information registered 
      by the sensors is processed and managed by a mobile application that facilitates 
      the expert's normal routine, while reducing the impact of human errors and 
      expediting the analysis of the test results. In order to show the potential of 
      the mDurance system, a case study has been conducted. The results of this study 
      prove the reliability of mDurance and further demonstrate that practitioners are 
      certainly interested in the regular use of a system of this nature.

TI  - Postural habits and weight of backpacks of Portuguese adolescents: Are they 
      associated with scoliosis and low back pain?
PG  - 197-208
LID - 10.3233/WOR-162284 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The adoption of incorrect postures or carrying overweight backpacks 
      may contribute to the development of musculoskeletal disorders in school 
      children. OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the weight of backpacks and the 
      postural habits adopted in schools by Portuguese adolescents, and their 
      association with scoliosis and low back pain (LBP). METHOD: The sample comprised 
      966 Portuguese students, aged between 10 and 16 years. The instruments included a 
      questionnaire to characterize the presence of LBP and the postural habits adopted 
      by students, the weighing of backpacks and a scoliometer to evaluate scoliosis. 
      RESULTS: No association was observed between assuming incorrect postures and 
      carrying overweight backpacks, in students with scoliosis. Students who adopted 
      incorrect sitting postures had 1.77 times the risk (95% CI: 1.32-2.36; p < 0.001) 
      of developing LBP; those positioned incorrectly whilst watching TV and playing 
      games had 1.44 times the risk (95% CI: 1.08-1.90; p = 0.012) of developing LBP; 
      and those standing incorrectly had 2.39 the risk (95% CI: 1.52-3.78; p < 0.001) 
      of developing LBP. CONCLUSIONS: The results revealed that students who sat with 
      the spine positioned wrongly, as well as those who were standing incorrectly, 
      were more likely to present with LBP.

AB  - Low back pain is regarded as the primary cause of occupational disability in many 
      countries worldwide. However, there is a lack of valid assessment of kinematic 
      spine and trunk parameters to provide further insight into occupational spine 
      loads. A new 3-dimensional mobile measurement system (3D-SpineMoveGuard) was 
      developed and evaluated by means of repeated dynamic and isometric trunk 
      positions by 10 male and 10 female volunteers. The interclass correlation 
      coefficient indicates high test-retest reliability (r = 0.975-0.999) of the 
      3D-SpineMoveGuard. Moreover, analysis of validity revealed almost identical 
      results for the new measurement system. The evaluation study indicates a good 
      scientific quality for the use in occupational task analyses. The objective 
      assessment of indirectly measured spine and trunk kinematics will give further 
      insight to predict and prevent job-related spine loads.

TI  - Wearable Device to Monitor Back Movements Using an Inductive Textile Sensor.
LID - 10.3390/s20030905 [doi]
LID - 905
AB  - Low back pain (LBP) is the most common work-related musculoskeletal disorder 
      among healthcare workers and is directly related to long hours of working in 
      twisted/bent postures or with awkward trunk movements. It has already been 
      established that providing relevant feedback helps individuals to maintain better 
      body posture during the activities of daily living. With the goal of preventing 
      LBP through objective monitoring of back posture, this paper proposes a wireless, 
      comfortable, and compact textile-based wearable platform to track trunk movements 
      when the user bends forward. The smart garment developed for this purpose was 
      prototyped with an inductive sensor formed by sewing a copper wire into an 
      elastic fabric in a zigzag pattern. The results of an extensive simulation study 
      showed that this unique design increases the inductance value of the sensor, and, 
      consequently, improves its resolution. Furthermore, experimental evaluation on a 
      healthy participant confirmed that the proposed wearable system with the 
      suggested sensor design can easily detect forward bending movements. The 
      evaluation scenario was then extended to also include twisting and lateral 
      bending of the trunk, and it was observed that the proposed design can 
      successfully discriminate such movements from forward bending of the trunk. 
      Results of the magnetic interference test showed that, most notably, moving a 
      cellphone towards the unworn prototype affects sensor readings, however, 
      manipulating a cellphone, when wearing the prototype, did not affect the 
      capability of the sensor in detecting forward bends. The proposed platform is a 
      promising step toward developing wearable systems to monitor back posture in 
      order to prevent or treat LBP.

TI  - Short-term effects of the suboccipital muscle inhibition technique and 
      cranio-cervical flexion exercise on hamstring flexibility, cranio-vertebral 
      angle, and range of motion of the cervical spine in subjects with neck pain: A 
      randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 1025-1034
LID - 10.3233/BMR-171016 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cervical spinal instability often leads to neck pain and forward head 
      posture (FHP). To improve neck pain and FHP, both the suboccipital muscle 
      inhibition (SMI) technique and cranio-cervical flexion exercise (CCFE) have been 
      used. However, little is known regarding the validity of hamstring flexibility in 
      neck pain subjects after CCFE as a treatment index, and comparison between the 
      SMI technique and CCFE for neck pain treatment. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to 
      determine the short-term effects of SMI technique and CCFE, which represent 
      passive and active exercise programs, respectively, and whether these improve the 
      straight leg raise (SLR) test results, popliteal angle (PA), cranio-vertebral 
      angle (CVA), and cervical range of motion (CROM) and are equally effective in 
      immediate enhancement of such measures in neck pain subjects. METHODS: Twenty 
      subjects with neck pain were randomly allocated to the SMI and CCFE groups (n= 10 
      each). The outcomes were evaluated via clinical evaluation and SLR, PA, CVA, and 
      CROM measurement before and after intervention. RESULTS: SLR test results, PA, 
      CVA (sitting and standing), and CROM (flexion, extension, lateral flexion, and 
      right and left rotations) after both interventions were significantly higher than 
      those before the interventions (P< 0.05). The SLR test results (left), PA, and 
      CVA (standing) after the SMI technique improved to levels similar to those 
      observed after CCFE. CONCLUSIONS: Both the SMI technique and CCFE improve SLR 
      test results, PA, CVA, and CROM and are equally effective in immediate 
      enhancement of the hamstring flexibility, CVA, and CROM in subjects with neck 
      pain.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the effects of Eutony, Holistic 
      Gymnastics, and Pilates on hamstring flexibility and back pain in pre-adolescent 
      girls. METHODS: This randomized prospective quantitative clinical trial compared 
      the effects of Eutony, Holistic Gymnastics, and Pilates on hamstring flexibility 
      and back pain. The sample consisted of 80 pre-adolescent girls aged 10-13 years 
      and divided into three groups: Eutony, with 26 girls; Holistic Gymnastics, 27 
      girls; and Pilates, 27 girls. The participants underwent ten 1-h weekly 
      interventions. Hamstring flexibility was evaluated using fingertip-to-floor, 
      sit-and-reach, and hip angle tests; back pain was evaluated using the Body 
      Posture Evaluation Instrument questionnaire and the way they carried their 
      backpack by the Layout for Assessing Dynamic Posture. Descriptive statistical 
      analysis, analysis of variance, and Kruskal-Wallis test were performed at a 5 % 
      significance level (p < 0.05). RESULTS: The three body practices increased 
      hamstring flexibility in all fingertip-to-floor (7.77 cm), hip angle (5.58°), and 
      sit-and-reach evaluations (9.07 cm). Before the intervention, 66.25 % of 
      participants complained of back pain. After the intervention, only 37.50 % 
      continued with the complaint. Moreover, 25 % of pre-adolescent girls started to 
      carry their school backpack correctly. CONCLUSION: Eutony, Holistic Gymnastics, 
      and Pilates increased hamstring flexibility, reduced back pain complaints, and 
      incentivized the girls to carry the school backpack correctly. REGISTRY OF

AB  - Currently, the word 'comfort' is often used in relation to the marketing of 
      products such as chairs, cars interiors, clothing, hand tools and even airplane 
      tickets. In this field of research, the aim of this study is to investigate the 
      influence of spinal posture on postural (dis)comfort perception; the test case is 
      the analysis of the interaction between humans and vending machines for 
      purchasing food or beverages. A statistical sample of 20 healthy students 
      (subjects) performed the required tests, with each participant asked to take a 
      product from three different vending machines (snacks, drinks and coffee). The 
      subjects' postures were acquired non-invasively using cameras; software and 
      instruments for virtual prototyping were used for posture analysis and 
      interaction modelling, both questionnaires (subjective) and comfort-analysis 
      software (objective) were used to rate the perceived (dis)comfort. The results 
      obtained from simulations and questionnaires were compared, and a method to weigh 
      the effect of the perceived spinal discomfort on overall postural (dis)comfort 
      was proposed. These results reveal a good correlation between subjective 
      perception and objective evaluation obtained through simulations, confirming the 
      validity of the proposed method.

TI  - Pilates-based therapeutic exercise: effect on subjects with nonspecific chronic 
      low back pain and functional disability: a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 472-84
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: A randomized controlled trial, prestest-posttest design, with a 3-, 
      6-, and 12-month follow-up. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the efficacy of a 
      therapeutic exercise approach in a population with chronic low back pain (LBP). 
      BACKGROUND: Therapeutic approaches developed from the Pilates method are becoming 
      increasingly popular; however, there have been no reports on their efficacy. 
      METHODS AND MEASURES: Thirty-nine physically active subjects between 20 and 55 
      years old with chronic LBP were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 groups. The 
      specific-exercise-training group participated in a 4-week program consisting of 
      training on specialized (Pilates) exercise equipment, while the control group 
      received the usual care, defined as consultation with a physician and other 
      specialists and healthcare professionals, as necessary. Treatment sessions were 
      designed to train the activation of specific muscles thought to stabilize the 
      lumbar-pelvic region. Functional disability outcomes were measured with The 
      Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMQ/RMDQ-HK) and average pain intensity 
      using a 101-point numerical rating scale. RESULTS: There was a significantly 
      lower level of functional disability (P = .023) and average pain intensity (P = 
      .002) in the specific-exercise-training group than in the control group following 
      the treatment intervention period. The posttest adjusted mean in functional 
      disability level in the specific-exercise-training group was 2.0 (95% CI, 1.3 to 
      2.7) RMQ/RMDQ-HK points compared to a posttest adjusted mean in the control group 
      of 3.2 (95% CI, 2.5 to 4.0) RMQ/RMDQ-HK points. The posttest adjusted mean in 
      pain intensity in the specific-exercise-training group was 18.3 (95% CI, 11.8 to 
      24.8), as compared to 33.9 (95% CI, 26.9 to 41.0) in the control group. Improved 
      disability scores in the specific-exercise-training group were maintained for up 
      to 12 months following treatment intervention. CONCLUSIONS: The individuals in 
      the specific-exercise-training group reported a significant decrease in LBP and 
      disability, which was maintained over a 12-month follow-up period. Treatment with 
      a modified Pilates-based approach was more efficacious than usual care in a 
      population with chronic, unresolved LBP.

AB  - Minimally invasive surgical approaches have revolutionized surgical care and 
      considerably improved surgical outcomes. The instrumentation has changed 
      significantly from open to laparoscopic and robotic surgery with various 
      usability and ergonomics qualities. To establish guidelines for future designing 
      of surgical instruments, this study assesses the effects of current surgical 
      approaches and instruments on the surgeon. Furthermore, an analysis of surgeons' 
      preferences with respect to instrument handles was performed to identify the main 
      acceptance criteria. In all, 49 surgeons (24 with robotic surgery experience, 25 
      without) completed the survey about physical discomfort and working conditions. 
      The respondents evaluated comfort, intuitiveness, precision, and stability of 7 
      instrument handles. Robotic surgery procedures generally take a longer time than 
      conventional procedures but result in less back, shoulder, and wrist pain; 28% of 
      surgeons complained about finger and neck pain during robotic surgery. Three 
      handles (conventional needle holder, da Vinci wrist, and joystick-like handle) 
      received significantly higher scores for most of the proposed criteria. The 
      handle preference is best explained by a regression model related only to comfort 
      and precision (R(2) = 0.91) and is significantly affected by the surgeon's 
      background (P < .001). Although robotic surgery seems to alleviate physical 
      discomfort during and after surgery, the results of this study show that there is 
      room for improvement in the sitting posture and in the ergonomics of the handles. 
      Comfort and precision have been found to be the most important aspects for the 
      surgeon's choice of an instrument handle. Furthermore, surgeons' professional 
      background should be considered when designing novel surgical instruments.

TI  - Effectiveness of back school versus McKenzie exercises in patients with chronic 
      nonspecific low back pain: a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 729-47
LID - 10.2522/ptj.20120414 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Back School and McKenzie methods are popular active treatment 
      approaches that include both exercises and information for patients with chronic 
      nonspecific low back pain. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare 
      the effectiveness of Back School and McKenzie methods in patients with chronic 
      nonspecific low back pain. DESIGN: The study was a prospectively registered, 
      2-arm randomized controlled trial with a blinded assessor. SETTING: The study was 
      conducted in the outpatient physical therapy clinic in São Paulo, Brazil. 
      PATIENTS: The study participants were 148 patients with chronic nonspecific low 
      back pain. INTERVENTIONS: The 4-week treatment program (one session/week) was 
      based on the Back School (delivered to the group) or McKenzie (delivered 
      individually) principles. The participants also were instructed to perform a 
      daily set of home exercises. MEASUREMENTS: Clinical outcomes were assessed at 
      follow-up appointments at 1, 3, and 6 months after randomization. Primary outcome 
      measures were pain intensity (measured by the 0-10 pain numerical rating scale) 
      and disability (measured by the 24-item Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire) 1 
      month after randomization. Secondary outcome measures were pain intensity and 
      disability at 3 and 6 months after randomization, quality of life (measured by 
      the World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF instrument) at 1, 3, and 6 
      months after randomization, and trunk flexion range of motion measured by an 
      inclinometer at 1 month after randomization. The data were collected by a blinded 
      assessor. RESULTS: Participants allocated to the McKenzie group had greater 
      improvements in disability at 1 month (mean effect=2.37 points, 95% confidence 
      interval=0.76 to 3.99) but not for pain (mean effect=0.66 points, 95% confidence 
      interval=-0.29 to 1.62). No between-group differences were observed for all 
      secondary outcome measures. LIMITATIONS: It was not possible to monitor the home 
      exercise program. Therapists and participants were not blinded. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      McKenzie method (a more resource-intensive intervention) was slightly more 
      effective than the Back School method for disability, but not for pain intensity 
      immediately after treatment in participants with chronic low back pain.

TI  - Prospective randomized feasibility study comparing manual vs. automatic 
      position-adaptive spinal cord stimulation with surgical leads.
PG  - 1571-1578
LID - 10.1007/s00701-019-03943-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The majority of patients experience uncomfortable stimulation 
      associated with posture changes, especially when lying down. The spinal cord 
      moves within the intrathecal space in response to positional changes affecting 
      the size of the stimulated area accordingly and causing overstimulation or 
      understimulation. To accommodate for positional changes, patients have to 
      manually adjust the stimulation parameters; therefore, an automatic 
      position-adaptive SCS was designed to address these issues. The primary objective 
      of this study was to establish the extent of position-related variations in SCS 
      stimulation parameters experienced by chronic pain patients implanted with 
      surgical, laminectomy-type leads under both automatic and manual SCS conditions. 
      METHODS: A total of 18 patients completed a single-center, prospective, 
      non-blinded, randomized (1:1), feasibility clinical study with a two-arm 
      crossover design. All patients undergoing SCS treatment for chronic refractory 
      back and or leg pain associated with failed back surgery, post-laminectomy, or 
      radicular pain syndromes that were refractory to conservative and surgical 
      interventions were eligible for enrollment. After the manual stimulation mode, 
      the patients were randomized to one of two study arms: manual or automatic 
      position-adaptive stimulation and then crossed over to a different arm. All 
      patients were followed for a total of 5 months (± 2 weeks). RESULTS: Analysis 
      indicated statistically significant differences between therapeutic and threshold 
      stimulation intensity for the supine position compared with all other body 
      positions when using either automatic position-adaptive stimulation or manual 
      stimulation, except for threshold amplitudes in the prone position for automatic 
      stimulation. CONCLUSION: Similar variations were reported for manual and 
      automatic stimulation intensity in response to positional changes.

TI  - Participatory ergonomics in redesigning a dyeing tub for fabric dyers.
PG  - 453-8
LID - 10.3233/WOR-2012-1462 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The 'saree' worn by women in India and many South Asian countries is 
      dyed using a tub, usually in small scale units employing low capital and a small 
      number of workers. While using these tubs, workers adopt awkward postures over 
      long periods of time which results in severe discomfort in the neck, shoulders 
      and lower extremities. The purpose of the study was to redesign the dyeing tub 
      using a participatory approach and to study the impact of the newly designed tub 
      on the reported body discomfort and rate of production. METHODS: Redesigning of 
      the dyeing tub was carried out using three parallel participative processes--(1) 
      eliciting the views of workers who use the tub, (2) interacting with the 
      proprietors of the small scale dyeing units (the employers) and the tub 
      manufacturers, and (3) iterative prototype tub development based on inputs from 
      the first two processes. These processes facilitated involvement of the 
      stake-holders and the acceptance of change. The final prototype was tested by 
      nine workers for a period of three months to evaluate the reduction in body 
      discomfort and increase in rate of production (output). RESULTS: Studies on the 
      impact of the new tub showed a reduction in discomfort level from 'severe' to 
      'moderate', and a mean increase of 7.9% in the output, confirming the benefits of 
      the participative approach to ergonomics intervention. The involvement, trust and 
      credibility generated by the participative process facilitated the acceptance of 
      the final design.

TI  - Loss of lumbar lordosis. A complication of spinal fusion for scoliosis.
PG  - 383-93
AB  - Symptomatic loss of lumbar lordosis is a disabling complication of scoliosis 
      surgery. This so-called "flat-back syndrome" is characterized by an inability to 
      stand erect and by upper back pain. Distraction instrumentation extending into 
      the lower lumbar spine or sacrum is the most frequently identified etiologic 
      factor responsible for loss of lordosis. The more distal the level of 
      instrumentation, the severer the loss of lumbar lordosis. Other factors that may 
      aggravate the loss of lordosis include thoracolumbar kyphosis, fixed thoracic 
      kyphosis, hip flexion contractures, and pseudoarthrosis. Because of the wide 
      range of values for kyphosis and lordosis in normal individuals, there is no 
      absolute value that can be considered "normal." It is the overall sagittal plane 
      balance that is most important. The most useful radiographic measurement to 
      evaluate this sagittal plane balance is the full-length standing lateral 
      radiograph with the knees extended. On this view, the C7-S1 measurement should 
      fall within 2 cm of the anterior aspect of the sacrum. Surgical treatment for 
      symptomatic loss of lumbar lordosis consists of closing wedge osteotomies through 
      the fusion mass. This should generally be preceded by an anterior release and 
      interbody fusion. Correction should be obtained at the site of the deformity with 
      particular attention paid to the thoracolumbar junction. The surgery is difficult 
      and the risk of complication is high. The most important aspect of this postural 
      disorder is prevention. Avoid distraction instrumentation that extends into the 
      lumbar spine if possible. When distraction instrumentation is used, the 
      techniques described will help preserve lumbar lordosis. When performing a fusion 
      to the sacrum, distraction instrumentation should not be used.

TI  - History taking by physiotherapists with low back pain patients: are illness 
      perceptions addressed properly?
PG  - 1268-79
LID - 10.3109/09638288.2015.1077530 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Despite the increasing evidence that illness perceptions should be 
      addressed in patients, there is a lack of studies evaluating whether 
      physiotherapists question illness perceptions. This study, using a mixed-methods 
      design, investigates the integration of illness perceptions during the first 
      consultation of physiotherapists treating patients with low back pain (LBP). 
      METHODS: Thirty-four physiotherapists performed usual history taking in a patient 
      with non-specific LBP. The interview was audiotaped and illness perceptions were 
      indexed using an observational instrument, based on the domains of Leventhal's 
      Common Sense Model. Patients were also asked to fill in the Illness Perception 
      Questionnaire-Revised for LBP. RESULTS: Physiotherapists assessed the illness 
      identity, also perceptions regarding the (physical) cause and controllability of 
      LBP were evaluated. Illness perceptions, such as timeline, consequences, 
      coherence and emotional representation, were poorly assessed. Results of the 
      questionnaire reveal that LBP-patients report overuse, workload and bad posture 
      as primary cause. Patients held positive beliefs about the controllability and 
      have high illness coherence. CONCLUSION: Belgian physiotherapists mainly question 
      bio-medically oriented illness perceptions, e.g. physical symptoms and causes, 
      but do not sufficiently address psychosocially oriented illness perceptions as 
      recommended in LBP guidelines. IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION: Belgian 
      physiotherapists mainly question biomedical oriented illness perceptions (illness 
      identity, provoking factors and treatment control) in patients with low back pain 
      (LBP) during the history taking (i.e. the first consultation). From a 
      bio-psycho-social view psychosocially oriented illness perceptions should be 
      incorporated in the daily routine of physiotherapist's to comply with the 
      bio-psycho-social treatment guidelines for LBP. Continuing education is mandatory 
      in order to improve physiotherapists' knowledge regarding the use of all 
      dimensions of illness perceptions in the assessment of patients with LBP.

TI  - Investigating the Effects of Percussion Therapy on Ultrasonography-Diagnosed 
      Thoracolumbar Fascia on Trigger Points and Hyperlordosis in Low Back Pain: A 
      Placebo-Controlled Trial.
LID - AT11279 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Thoracolumbar fascia (TLF) is crucial for stabilization and load 
      distribution. Individuals with non-specific low back pain (NSLBP) and 
      hyperlordosis present with trigger points (TrPs) and tight TLF. 
      Instrument-assisted percussion therapy (IAPT) is a form of vibration therapy used 
      for the release of fascia. However, the effect of IAPT has not been well 
      understood on TrPs in TLF and its effect on posture. PRIMARY STUDY OBJECTIVE: To 
      determine the effect of IAPT on hyperlordotic posture, pelvic inclination, TrPs, 
      and disability in NSLBP. Another aim was to evaluate the tangible effect of IAPT 
      on TrPs. METHODS/DESIGN: Double-blinded placebo-controlled trial conducted on 
      NSLBP patients with lumbar hyperlordosis. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-two participants 
      with NSLBP were randomly allocated into IAPT and placebo groups. INTERVENTION: 
      The Interventional group (n = 16) underwent IAPT and the placebo group (n = 16) 
      underwent sham IAPT along with interferential therapy (IFT) and cryotherapy for 
      alternate days over two weeks. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Pre- and 
      post-intervention (2 weeks) both the groups were evaluated for TrPs using a 
      pressure algometer, diagnostic USG to assess dimensions of TrPs on TLF, Index of 
      lumbar lordosis (ILL), Lumbar lordosis curve (LLC) using flexicurve, pelvic tilt 
      (PT) angle using bubble inclinometer, and Modified Oswestry Disability Index 
      (MODI). RESULTS: Upon between-group comparison, for PT (P = .0009), ILL (P = 
      .0001), LLC (P = .0033), length (P = .0007), and breadth of TrPs (P = .0004), the 
      improvements were significantly better in IAPT group than the control group 
      except for PPT (P = .2834) and MODI (P = .0135) where both the groups were 
      equally effective. CONCLUSION: IAPT is an effective method of releasing TrPs and 
      correcting hyperlordotic lumbar and pelvic posture in individuals with NSLBP. 
      Further, the study created confirmatory evidence that IAPT is effective for 
      treating TrPs and is not merely a placebo effect.

TI  - A 3-D skeleton model & SEMG approach for integrated neck and low back pain 
      analysis test batteries.
PG  - 79-84
AB  - Since several years our group is working on a project to merge into a full 3D 
      reliable and detailed human skeleton representation various segmental 
      biomechanical models presented in literature. The obtained 3D skeleton model is 
      fully parametric and can be fitted to each subject anthropometric 
      characteristics. A non-ionising approach based on 3D opto-electronic measurements 
      of body landmarks labelled by passive markers has been chosen to build the 3D 
      parametric biomechanical skeleton model. A special focus has been devoted to 
      identify and model the spine with a correct degree of accuracy and reliability. 
      In spine pain related pathologies is of major importance the evaluation of 
      functional limitations associated. This requires to integrate morphological 
      characteristics with information deriving from other measurements devices as 
      force platform data, surface EMG, foot pressure maps. The aim of this study is to 
      present a multi-factorial approach which integrates rachis morphological 
      characteristics with full skeleton kinematic, dynamic and SEMG measurements to 
      quantify spine function and mobility in particular for neck and low back pain. A 
      set of clinical-biomechanical tests have been implemented. Static posture 
      characteristics are first evaluated. After that, patient is asked to perform 
      specific motion test batteries in order to fully measure the whole ROMs (spine 
      angles ranges and spine shape modifications) for Axial rotations, 
      forward-backward flexion-extension, lateral bendings per each spine functional 
      units (Skull and neck, thoracic and lumbar districts). During forward bending 
      also a digital Schober test is performed. Such data are correlated to 
      simultaneous SEMG muscle activities recording to investigate motor 
      co-ordination/dysfunction as well as the presence absence of flexion-relaxation 
      phenomena associated to pain.

TI  - Quantification of Lumbar Stability During Wall Plank-and-Roll Activity Using 
      Inertial Sensors.
PG  - 803-813
LID - 10.1016/j.pmrj.2015.03.004 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop a simple method of quantifying dynamic lumbar stability by 
      evaluating postural changes of the lumbar spine during a wall plank-and-roll 
      (WPR) activity while maintaining maximal trunk rigidity. DESIGN: A descriptive, 
      exploratory research with a convenience sample. SETTING: A biomechanics 
      laboratory of a tertiary university hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Sixteen healthy young 
      subjects (8 men and 8 women; 30.7 ± 6.8 years old) and 3 patients (2 men 46 and 
      50 years old; 1 woman 54 years old) with low back pain (LBP). METHODS: The 
      subjects performed the WPR activity with 2 inertial sensors attached on the 
      thoracic spine and sacrum. Relative angles between the sensors were calculated to 
      characterize lumbar posture in 3 anatomical planes: axial twist (AT), 
      kyphosis-lordosis (KL), or lateral bending (LB). Isokinetic truncal flexion and 
      extension power were measured. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: AT, KL, and LB were 
      compared between the initial plank and maximal roll positions. Angular excursions 
      were compared between males and females and between rolling sides, and tested for 
      correlation with isokinetic truncal muscle power. Patterns and consistencies of 
      the lumbar postural changes were determined. Lumbar postural changes of each 
      patient were examined in the aspects of pattern and excursion, considering those 
      from the healthy subjects as reference. RESULTS: AT, KL, and LB were 
      significantly changed from the initial plank to the maximal roll position (P < 
      .01); that is, the thoracic spine rotated further, lumbar lordosis increased, and 
      the thoracic spine was bent away from the wall by 6.9° ± 12.0°, 9.5° ± 6.5°, and 
      7.9° ± 4.9°, respectively. The patterns and amounts of lumbar postural changes 
      were not significantly different between the rolling sides or between male and 
      female participants, except that the excursion in AT was larger on the dominant 
      rolling side. The excursions were not related to isokinetic truncal muscle power. 
      The 3 LBP patients showed varied deviations in pattern and excursion from the 
      average of the healthy subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Certain amounts and patterns of 
      lumbar postural changes were observed in healthy young subjects, with no 
      significant variations based on gender, rolling side, or truncal muscle power. 
      Application of the evaluation on LBP patients revealed prominent deviations from 
      the healthy postural changes, suggesting potential clinical applicability. 
      Therefore, with appropriate development and case stratification, we believe that 
      the quantification of lumbar postural changes during WPR activity can be used to 
      assess dynamic lumbar stability in clinical practice.

AB  - The objectives of this study were to compare the effects of three different 
      Pilates regimes on chronic, mild low back pain symptoms and to determine whether 
      the efficiency of load transfer through the pelvis is improved by those 
      exercises. A between subjects equivalent group experimental design was used. The 
      independent variable was the type of exercise training (three groups) and the 
      two-dependent variables were low back pain symptoms and load transfer through the 
      pelvis. The outcome measures of the first-dependent variable were a comparison 
      between modified Oswestry Disability Questionnaires (one of the standard pain 
      instruments) completed pre- and post-program and frequency, intensity and 
      duration of low back pain. The outcome measure of the second-dependent variable, 
      efficiency of load transfer through the pelvis was the Stork test (one-legged 
      standing test) in weight bearing. Although all groups experienced statistically 
      significant reductions in frequency, intensity and duration of low back pain 
      across the weeks of exercising, there were no significant differences between the 
      groups relative to each other.

TI  - Towards monitoring lumbo-pelvic posture in real-life situations: concurrent 
      validity of a novel posture monitor and a traditional laboratory-based motion 
      analysis system.
PG  - 77-83
LID - 10.1016/j.math.2011.09.006 [doi]
AB  - Many factors are associated with low back pain (LBP), including provocative 
      spinal postures. Consequently, lumbo-pelvic posture is commonly assessed in LBP 
      patients. A novel wireless monitor (BodyGuard™) can monitor lumbo-pelvic sagittal 
      plane movements reliably, and has demonstrated concurrent validity during 
      non-functional tasks. This study evaluated the concurrent validity of this 
      monitor during functional tasks, as a precursor to LBP field studies. Twelve 
      painfree participants performed a series of postural tasks (in sitting and 
      standing) three times. Simultaneous postural measurements were obtained by the 
      wireless monitor and a laboratory-based system (CODA™). Postural measurements 
      were strongly correlated (r(s) = 0.88, r(2) = 0.78). The mean difference observed 
      was small (<10% lumbo-pelvic ROM), however some tasks displayed greater error. 
      The results support the concurrent validity of the wireless monitor for analysing 
      lumbo-pelvic posture during functional tasks. Specific limitations of the monitor 
      for certain postural tasks were identified, and should be considered before 
      implementation in future field studies.

      prevention of low back pain during prolonged sitting.
PG  - E674-7
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Subjective ratings of discomfort were compared between a fixed 
      lumbar support and lumbar support continuous passive motion (CPM) device. 
      OBJECTIVE: To compare a fixed lumbar support with a lumbar support CPM device 
      during prolonged sitting. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: To prevent low back pain 
      during prolonged sitting, an inflatable lumbar support CPM has been developed. 
      There are no studies that compare static lumbar support with lumbar CPM using the 
      same pressure in the cushions. METHODS: A total of 31 male volunteers without low 
      back pain sat in the same chair for a 2-hour period on each of 3 consecutive days 
      under 3 randomized test methods: 1, no lumbar support; 2, static lumbar support; 
      and 3, lumbar support CPM. Each subject rated low back pain, stiffness, fatigue, 
      and buttock numbness on a visual analog scale (VAS). Fixed lumbar support and CPM 
      device were compared with a same inflation pressure in the cushion. For 10 
      subjects, the whole body posture and the pressure distribution changes of the 
      human-seat interface during CPM were evaluated. RESULTS: Compared with no lumbar 
      support, a significant improvement in VAS scores for low back pain, stiffness, 
      and fatigue was obtained with both static lumbar support and with lumbar support 
      CPM (P < 0.005). A significant (P < 0.005) improvement for buttock numbness was 
      obtained only with lumbar support CPM. There were no statistical differences in 
      all VAS scores between the fixed lumbar support and the CPM device. A forward 
      rotation of the pelvic region was obtained during inflation of the cushion during 
      CPM. Significant differences (P < 0.05) were found between cushion inflation and 
      deflation periods both in contact areas and in the peak pressures at the 
      human-seat interface. CONCLUSION: There were no statistical differences in the 
      subjective ratings of discomfort between the fixed lumbar support and the CPM 
      device.

AB  - Parents, educators and researchers have expressed concern about the long term 
      impacts of children carrying excessive loads in their backpacks on a daily basis. 
      Although many researchers have investigated appropriate weight limits for 
      children's packs, little research has been conducted on the design of children's 
      backpacks. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the changes in children's 
      trunk forward lean (TFL), cranio-vertebral angle (CVA) and spinal lordosis angle 
      (LA) that occurred with high, medium and low load locations during standing and 
      walking. Ten-year-old children (n = 15) completed a repeated measures designed 
      study while carrying 15% of each child's body weight in a typical backpack with 
      only shoulder straps. A special instrumented backpack (IBP) was designed that 
      allowed the weight to be placed in the proper location and continuously measure 
      changes in spinal curvature. TFL and CVA postures were captured on digital video 
      at five intervals including: standing without a backpack prior to a 1000 m walk; 
      standing with a backpack at the beginning and end of a 1000 m walk; and walking 
      with a backpack at the beginning and end of a 1000 m walk. Results indicated that 
      significant changes occurred in TFL and CVA when the backpack was loaded to 15% 
      body weight. The low load placement in the backpack produced fewer changes in CVA 
      from the initial standing baseline measure than the high and mid placements. When 
      all measures were assessed collectively, there were fewer changes in LA in the 
      low load placement. These findings indicate that future backpack designs should 
      place loads lower on the spine in order to minimize children's postural 
      adaptations.

AB  - STUDY DESIGN: A randomized prospective cohort study of participants with chronic 
      low back pain, seeking physical therapy, with follow-up at weeks 6 and 28. 
      Effects of conventional physiotherapy and physiotherapy with the addition of 
      postural biofeedback were compared. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the benefits of 
      postural biofeedback in chronic low back pain participants. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND 
      DATA: Biofeedback using electromyographic signals has been used in chronic low 
      back pain with mixed results. Postural feedback had not been previously used. 
      METHODS: Demographic and psychological baseline data along with range of motion 
      were analyzed from a sample of 47 chronic participants with low back pain 
      randomized into conventional physiotherapy with or without the addition of 
      postural biofeedback. RESULTS: After 6 months, there were 21 dropouts. The 
      participants with biofeedback had markedly improved status in visual analog pain 
      scales, short form-36, and range of motion. CONCLUSION: The study strongly 
      suggests that postural feedback is a useful adjunct to conventional physiotherapy 
      of chronic low back pain participants.

TI  - The use of muscle dynamometer for correction of muscle imbalances in the area of

LID - 10.1177/0954411913486078 [doi]
AB  - Dorsal pain caused by spine dysfunctions belongs to most frequent chronic 
      illnesses. The muscles of the deep stabilising spine system work as a single 
      functional unit where a dysfunction of only one muscle causes dysfunction of the 
      whole system. Non-invasive, objective and statistically measurable evaluation of 
      the condition of deep stabilising spine system has been made possible by the 
      construction of muscular dynamometer. The aim of our work has been the assessment 
      of deep stabilising spine system by diaphragm test and muscular dynamometer 
      measurements. Based on an initial examination, a 6-week intervention programme 
      was established including instructions on physiological body posture and correct 
      basic body stabilisation for the given exercises and muscle strengthening. 
      Consecutive measurements are then compared with the initial ones. It was presumed 
      that a smaller number of the tested subjects would be able to correctly activate 
      the deep stabilising spine system muscles before the intervention programme when 
      compared to those after the intervention programme. A positive change of 87% has 
      been found. It is clear that if a person actively approaches the programme, then 
      positive adaptation changes on the deep stabilising spine system are seen only 
      after 6 weeks. With the muscular dynamometer, activation of deep stabilising 
      spine system can be objectively measured. Changes between the initial condition 
      of a subject and the difference after some exercise or rehabilitation are 
      especially noticeable. Also, the effect of given therapy or correct performance 
      of the exercise can be followed and observed.

TI  - Functional Analysis of the Spine with the Idiag SpinalMouse System among 
      Sedentary Workers Affected by Non-Specific Low Back Pain.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph17249259 [doi]
LID - 9259
AB  - WHO describes "low back pain" (LBP) as the most common problem in overall 
      occupational-related diseases. The aim of this study was to evaluate 
      characteristics of spinal functionality among sedentary workers and determine 
      usability of the SpinalMouse(®) skin-surface measurement device in workplace 
      settings in a risk population for LBP. The spinal examination was implemented at 
      National Instruments Corporations' Hungarian subsidiary, Debrecen in October, 
      2015, involving 95 white-collar employees as volunteers to assess spinal posture 
      and functional movements. Data from the physical examination of 91 subjects (age: 
      34.22 ± 7.97 years) were analyzed. Results showed significant differences (p < 
      0.05) in posture and mobility of the spinal regions in sitting compared to 
      standing position. Significant positive correlations were observed between values 
      measured in standing and sitting positions in all observed regions and aspects of 
      the spine (p < 0.05) except posture of lumbar extension (p = 0.07) and mobility 
      of sacrum/hip in E-F (p = 0.818). Significant (p < 0.001) difference (5.70°) was 
      found between the spinal inclination in sitting 6.47 ± 3.55° compared to standing 
      0.77 ± 2.53 position. Sitting position has a negative effect on the posture and 
      mobility of the spine among white-collar employees. The SpinalMouse can be used 
      effectively to determine spinal posture and mobility in cross-sectional studies 
      and impact analysis of physical exercise interventions.

TI  - Are improvements in symptoms associated with changes in lumbopelvic posture in 
      patients with posterior derangement using Mechanical Diagnosis and Therapy?
PG  - 389-398
LID - 10.3233/BMR-181263 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mechanical Diagnosis and Therapy (MDT) manages low back pain (LBP) 
      with subgroup classifications. For a subgroup of the posterior derangement 
      syndrome, postural education limiting lumbar flexion is included. However, it is 
      not known if habitual posture in this subgroup actually changes through MDT 
      management because of technical difficulties in monitoring habitual lumbopelvic 
      posture. However, a wearable device, "LUMOback", which can evaluate the 
      proportion of time with a neutral lumbopelvic posture (posture score), has now 
      become available. OBJECTIVE: To preliminarily investigate whether the posture 
      score changes through the course of MDT management. METHODS: Primary inclusion 
      criterion was LBP with the posterior derangement syndrome. Primary outcome 
      measure was the posture score during one week. The posture score was assessed one 
      week before and six weeks after the initial MDT management, which included 
      extension exercises and postural education. RESULTS: All participants (n= 8) 
      reported a successful treatment effect after the 6-week MDT intervention; 
      however, there was no specific trend in the posture score (Friedman test: p= 
      0.277). CONCLUSIONS: This study found evidence that the proportion of time with a 
      neutral lumbopelvic posture during daily living, the posture score, which was 
      measured with the LUMOback, did not systematically change with MDT management.

TI  - Clinical characteristics of flexed posture in elderly women.
PG  - 1419-26
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the relationships between the severity of flexed 
      posture (FP), skeletal fragility, and functional status level in elderly women. 
      DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Geriatric rehabilitation research 
      hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Sixty elderly women (aged 70-93) with FP referred to a 
      geriatric rehabilitation department for chronic back pain without apparent 
      comorbid conditions. MEASUREMENTS: Multidimensional clinical assessment included 
      the severity of FP (standing occiput-to-wall distance) demographic (age) and 
      anthropometric (height, weight) data, clinical profile (number of falls, pain 
      assessment, Mini-Mental State Examination, Comorbidity Severity Index, Geriatric 
      Depression Scale, Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory), measures of skeletal 
      fragility (number of vertebral fractures by spine radiograph, bone mineral 
      density (BMD), and T-score of lumbar spine and proximal femur), muscular 
      impairment assessment (muscle strength and length), motor performance (Short 
      Physical Performance Battery, Performance Oriented Mobility Assessment, 
      instrumented gait analysis), and evaluation of disability (Barthel Index, 
      Nottingham Extended Activities of Daily Living Index). RESULTS: The severity of 
      FP was classified as mild in 11, moderate in 28, and severe in 21 patients. 
      Although there were no differences between FP groups on the skeletal fragility 
      measurements, the moderate and severe FP groups were significantly different from 
      the mild FP group for greater pain at the level of the cervical and lumbar spine. 
      The severe FP group was also significantly different from the mild but not the 
      moderate FP group in the following categories: clinical profile (greater 
      depression, reduced motivation), muscle impairment (weaker spine extensor, ankle 
      plantarflexor, and dorsiflexor muscles; shorter pectoralis and hip flexor 
      muscles), the motor function performance-based tests (lower scores in the balance 
      and gait subsets of the Performance Oriented Mobility Assessment), the 
      instrumented gait analysis (slower and wider base of support), and disability 
      (lower score on the Nottingham Extended Activities of Daily Living Index). The 
      total number of vertebral fractures was not associated with differences in 
      severity of FP, demographic and anthropometric characteristics, clinical profile, 
      muscular function, performance-based and instrumental measures of motor function, 
      and disability, but it was associated with reduced proximal femur and lumbar 
      spine BMD. CONCLUSION: The severity of FP in elderly female patients (without 
      apparent comorbid conditions) is related to the severity of vertebral pain, 
      emotional status, muscular impairments, and motor function but not to 
      osteoporosis, and FP has a measurable effect on disability. In contrast, the 
      presence of vertebral fractures in patients with FP is associated with lower BMD 
      but not patients' clinical and functional status. Therefore, FP, back pain, and 
      mobility problems can occur without osteoporosis. Older women with FP and 
      vertebral pain may be candidates for rehabilitation interventions that address 
      muscular impairments, posture, and behavior modification. Randomized controlled 
      trials are needed to support these conclusions.

TI  - Long-term sick leave and disability pensioning due to back disorders of tractor 
      drivers exposed to whole-body vibration.
PG  - 117-22
AB  - In a historical 11-year follow-up study, disability pensioning and the incidence 
      of the first sick leave of 4 weeks or longer due to back disorders has been 
      investigated in a group of drivers exposed to whole-body vibration (WBV), mainly 
      of agricultural tractors. The reference group comprised workers not or only 
      slightly exposed to WBV from the same and another company. The vibration exposure 
      of the tractor drivers was roughly around the ISO-2631 fatigue-decreased 
      proficiency limit. The incidence of a first long-term sick leave due to back 
      disorders was 3 per 100 person-years in tractor drivers and 2 per 100 
      person-years in the entire reference group. However, the incidence was not 
      substantially increased in tractor drivers when the referents comprised only 
      those working at the same company, suggesting selection bias. The highest 
      relative risk (ca. 3) was found for long-term sick leave due to intervertebral 
      disc disorders and this risk seemed to increase with the received WBV dose. That 
      especially the incidence of intervertebral disc disorders increased, agrees well 
      with findings in other studies. Data on disability pensioning due to back 
      disorders are too scarce to be conclusive, but a trend towards younger 
      disablement in tractor drivers is evident. Exposure to WBV, together with twisted 
      posture and prolonged sitting, are considered to be responsible for the increased 
      incidences observed in tractor drivers.

AB  - There is a paucity of information regarding the development of body posture 
      during adolescence. This three-year prospective study aimed to evaluate sitting 
      and sleeping postures among adolescents, and to determine whether these postures 
      are associated with age and sex. We assessed 525 adolescents aged 11-16 years 
      from the fifth to eighth grades. These adolescents were reassessed three years 
      later. The Back Pain and Body Posture Evaluation Instrument was used to evaluate 
      the sleeping posture and three sitting positions: sitting to write, to use a 
      computer, and during leisure activities. Our findings indicated a low prevalence 
      of adequate sleeping and sitting postures at baseline, with a decrease in 
      prevalence observed after three years for all postures. These changes were 
      similar for both sexes. Moreover, we found a strong reduction of adequate posture 
      prevalence for younger adolescents, but the oldest adolescents demonstrated no 
      significant differences after three years. Early, rather than late, adolescence 
      is a critical period for establishing inadequate sitting and sleeping postures. 
      This has implications for posture throughout adulthood; hence, interventions 
      targeted at this age group are needed.

TI  - EVALUATION OF AGRICULTURAL TRACTOR SEAT COMFORT WITH A NEW PROTOCOL BASED ON 
      PRESSURE DISTRIBUTION ASSESSMENT.
PG  - 13-26
LID - 10.13031/jash.12209 [doi]
AB  - Professional drivers have been found to be at a high risk of developing low back 
      pain due to prolonged sitting and vehicle vibration. In a previous survey carried 
      out on 1,155 tractor drivers, tractor vibration and/or incorrect posture while 
      driving were found to cause low back disorders in more than 80% of the 
      interviewed drivers. In this context, the present research introduces a new 
      evaluation protocol to assess the ergonomic characteristics of agricultural 
      tractor seats through the use of pressure sensors, taking into account both 
      static and dynamic conditions. The degree of comfort was defined by analyzing the 
      pressure distribution exerted by a sample of 12 drivers sitting on two seats in 
      five different operating conditions. The pressure distribution values thus 
      obtained were compared with the corresponding pressures recorded with the 12 
      drivers sitting on a reference seat (rigid seat, backrest, and suspension) 
      designed for the purpose. From the comparison, it was possible to define a 
      comfort index (CI) that allowed an objective assessment of the two seats. 
      Statistical analysis showed that the CIs of the two seats were significantly 
      different in all five operating conditions. Moreover, the two seats showed 
      different CIs as a function of the operating condition. Although less 
      comfortable, one seat showed almost constant CI values in all five operating 
      conditions. Conversely, the other seat showed a progressively decreasing CI from 
      the static condition to the uneven ground condition.

TI  - Postoperative changes in sagittal spinopelvic alignment in sitting position in 
      adolescents with idiopathic thoracic scoliosis treated with posterior fusion: an 
      initial analysis.

AB  - OBJECTIVE Previous studies have reported spinal straightening and pelvic 
      retroversion when changing from erect to sitting posture in patients with 
      adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS), which were thought to be related to 
      low-back pain after sitting for long periods. However, the sitting sagittal 
      alignment after posterior spinal fusion has not been evaluated. This study aims 
      to assess the influence of posterior fusion surgery upon sitting sagittal 
      spinopelvic alignment in adolescents with idiopathic thoracic curves (thoracic 
      AIS [T-AIS]). METHODS A total of 44 T-AIS patients (30 Lenke I and 14 Lenke II) 
      from the authors' center were included in this study. Preoperative and 
      postoperative long-cassette lateral radiographs of the spine and pelvis were 
      obtained with the patients in standing and sitting positions. Thoracic kyphosis 
      (TK), lumbar lordosis (LL), pelvic incidence (PI), sacral slope (SS), and pelvic 
      tilt (PT) were measured on standing and sitting lateral radiographs. Patients 
      were divided into selective thoracic fusion (STF) and nonselective thoracic 
      fusion (NSTF) groups. RESULTS At baseline, TK, LL, and SS decreased by 27.5%, 
      42.1%, and 31.1%, respectively, from the standing to the sitting position, while 
      PT increased by 193.6%. After posterior spinal fusion, increased TK, LL, and SS 
      and corresponding decreased PT were observed compared to baseline parameters in 
      the sitting position. Comparison of postoperative sitting and standing values for 
      the whole cohort showed that the mean LS and SS values were significantly lower 
      in the sitting position (decreased by 14.0% and 13.9%, respectively, compared to 
      standing), whereas the mean PT value was significantly greater (increased by 
      39.0%, compared to standing). Similar changes were also observed in the STF 
      group: postoperatively the mean LL value was 15.6% lower in sitting than in 
      standing, while the mean SS value was 11.5% lower. However, no obvious changes of 
      the postoperative values in sitting were found in the NSTF group. CONCLUSIONS 
      Nonselective thoracic fusion surgery in T-AIS patients diminished spinal 
      straightening and pelvic retroversion during sitting. Reducing distal fusion 
      levels was of special value in not only saving more lumbar mobility, but also 
      preserving the function of pelvic posterior rotation.

TI  - Treatment and biomechanical assessment of patients with chronic sacroiliac joint 
      syndrome.
PG  - 82-90
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate diagnostic and biomechanical correlates and treatment 
      outcomes of manipulative/adjustive care in patients highly selected for 
      sacroiliac joint syndrome (SIJS). DESIGN: Descriptive case series, 1 wk baseline, 
      1 yr follow-up. SETTING: Private chiropractic practice. PATIENTS: Ten out of 153 
      consecutive new patients (4 male and 6 female) with "primary," chronic, 
      uncomplicated SIJS were selected over an 11-mo period on the basis of painful SIJ 
      and provocation tests. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Back pain (visual analogue scale), 
      Oswestry disability index, lumbar provocation tests and biomechanical measures of 
      gait and postural sway. INTERVENTION: Six-wk regimen of mechanical force, 
      manually assisted, short lever adjustments (MFMA) with an Activator instrument. 
      RESULTS: Pain decreased significantly from a mean baseline value of 25 to 12 (t = 
      2.28; p < .05). Likewise, the average disability scores diminished from 28 to 13% 
      (t = 2.3; p < .05), and a reduction in the number of positive provocation tests 
      was noted (Fisher Exact Probability range Z = 0.025-0.045). Gait and sway 
      parameters were indistinguishable from normals, before or after treatment. 
      Response to the 1-yr follow-up questionnaire (6/10) revealed stability of 
      symptoms at a low level. CONCLUSIONS: While the majority of subjects recorded 
      some degree of positive outcome, we conclude that: a) discrete SIJS remains 
      difficult to diagnose, but may be possible by judicious choice of screening 
      tests; b) MFMA may benefit some patients with chronic SIJ pain; and c) gait and 
      sway measurement yielded no correlation with clinical conditions.

TI  - The effects of different maternal positions on non-stress test: an experimental 
      study.
PG  - 562-8
AB  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To determine the effects of different maternal positions on 
      non-stress test results and the preferences of mothers for involving positions. 
      BACKGROUND: The non-stress test (NST) has become a common tool in diagnosing 
      fetal risks. The major problem encountered in the application of the non-stress 
      test has been obtaining erroneous non-reactive non-stress test results when, 
      indeed, the fetus is healthy and oxygenation is sufficient. STUDY DESIGN: 
      Experiment design with randomly assigned four positions: supine, left lateral, 
      semi-fowler and sitting up. The sample included 408 women in a university 
      hospital in Turkey. Women were randomly assigned to four groups in equal numbers 
      of 102. Data collection and analysis. Data were collected through two 
      instruments: Demographic and Pregnancy History Form and NST tracing. Main outcome 
      measures were percentage of reactive NST and number of minutes for reactivity in 
      each position. RESULTS: There were significant (P < 0.05) differences among four 
      groups. Supine position showed the least fetal reactivity. In terms of time to 
      reactivity, there were no statistically significant differences. Qualitative data 
      showed that pregnant women were least comfortable in supine position reporting 
      back pain and shortening of breath. CONCLUSION: Supine position yields the lowest 
      non-reactivity in tandem with physical discomfort such as back pain and 
      difficulty in breathing. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Sitting up, semi-fowler 
      and left lateral positions are recommended to be used during the non-stress test. 
      In addition, the preferences of the pregnant women should be determined before 
      the test to minimize discomfort which, when it occurs, may signal physiological 
      alterations experienced during the test.

LID - 10.1080/00140139.2015.1079335 [doi]
AB  - The accuracy and repeatability of an inertial measurement unit (IMU) system for 
      directly measuring trunk angular displacement and upper arm elevation were 
      evaluated over eight hours (i) in comparison to a gold standard, optical motion 
      capture (OMC) system in a laboratory setting, and (ii) during a field-based 
      assessment of dairy parlour work. Sample-to-sample root mean square differences 
      between the IMU and OMC system ranged from 4.1° to 6.6° for the trunk and 
      7.2°-12.1° for the upper arm depending on the processing method. Estimates of 
      mean angular displacement and angular displacement variation (difference between 
      the 90th and 10th percentiles of angular displacement) were observed to 
      change <4.5° on average in the laboratory and <1.5° on average in the field per 
      eight hours of data collection. Results suggest the IMU system may serve as an 
      acceptable instrument for directly measuring trunk and upper arm postures in 
      field-based occupational exposure assessment studies with long sampling 
      durations. Practitioner Summary: Few studies have evaluated inertial measurement 
      unit (IMU) systems in the field or over long sampling durations. Results of this 
      study indicate that the IMU system evaluated has reasonably good accuracy and 
      repeatability for use in a field setting over a long sampling duration.

AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional and longitudinal designs within a prospective 
      cohort study. OBJECTIVE: Translation of Hannover Functional Ability Questionnaire 
      (FFbH-R) into Norwegian and examination of its factor structure, internal 
      consistency, reproducibility, construct validity, and responsiveness in patients 
      with long-lasting back pain. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Several 
      condition-specific instruments have been developed to evaluate functional status 
      in low back pain, but FFbH-R was the only instrument found to solely measure 
      perceived capability of performing daily activities. METHODS: Recommended 
      guidelines for translation of questionnaires and quality criteria for validation 
      were followed. A total of 111 patients (aged 18-65 years) with long-lasting back 
      pain were consecutively recruited from an outpatient spine clinic. Two additional 
      samples of patients with long-lasting back pain were added into the exploratory 
      factor analysis, giving a total number of 224 patients. Predefined hypotheses 
      regarding construct and longitudinal validity (responsiveness) were examined. 
      RESULTS: Factor analysis indicated that 2 items should be removed, resulting in a 
      3-factor solution as the best fit. The factors were related to flexibility, 
      dynamic strength, and posture endurance. Satisfactory internal consistency and 
      reproducibility were demonstrated for the total and subscales of the Norwegian 
      version of FFbH-R. Most of the predefined hypothesis regarding construct and 
      longitudinal validity were confirmed, and discriminate ability was shown. Minor 
      floor and ceiling effects were demonstrated. CONCLUSION: Psychometric properties 
      of the Norwegian version of FFbH-R were satisfactory in patients with 
      long-lasting back pain, but the dynamic strength and posture endurance subscales 
      might be complemented with additional items.

TI  - Effectiveness of the back school program for the performance of activities of 
      daily living in users of a basic health unit in Porto Alegre, Brazil.
PG  - 2581-2586
AB  - [Purpose] Primary care is considered the gateway to the Brazilian public health 
      system and is responsible for managing the most prevalent problems in the 
      population. In this study, the effects of Back School on pain, functionality, and 
      the performance of activities of daily living (ADL) in users with chronic 
      musculoskeletal pain were evaluated. [Subjects and Methods] Forty-four users (33 
      females and 11 males) participated in Back School, with five two-hour theoretical 
      and practical meetings held once a week. The assessment instruments used were as 
      follows: (a) a circuit evaluation of posture dynamics recorded on video, (b) an 
      observational instrument of ADL using video, (c) anamnesis, (d) the visual 
      analogue scale, and (e) the Oswestry Disability Index. [Results] The results 
      showed decreased pain intensity, improved functionality, and the recovery of ADL. 
      [Conclusion] The Back School program is an effective health education strategy 
      for users with chronic musculoskeletal pain.

TI  - A stabilization device to improve the quality of cardiopulmonary resuscitation 
      during ambulance transportation: a randomized crossover trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The quality of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) during ambulance 
      transportation is suboptimal, and therefore measures that can improve the quality 
      are desirable. PURPOSE: To evaluate whether the use of a stabilization device can 
      improve the quality of CPR during ambulance transportation. METHODS: This 
      randomized controlled crossover trial enrolled 22 experienced ambulance officers. 
      Each participant performed CPR in an ambulance under three conditions with 72 h 
      apart, each condition for 10 min: non-moving (NM), moving without device (MND), 
      and moving with device (MD). The sequences of conditions were randomized. The 
      primary outcomes were effective chest compressions recorded by the Laerdal 
      Resusci-Anne Skill-reporter manikin. The secondary outcomes included the severity 
      of back pain scored using the Brief Pain Inventory short-form, the physiology 
      parameter before and after CPR, and the changes in postural stability which was 
      represented by the sway index (SI) of lower back measured using a goniometer. 
      RESULTS: The overall effective compressions in 10 min were 87.0±17% for NM, 
      59.0±19% for MND, and 69.0±23% for MD (p<0.001). Compared to MND, MD had a lower 
      no-flow fraction while driving on curved sections (0.04 vs. 0.29, p<0.001). 
      Whereas the pain severity and social interference scores were similar under all 
      conditions, MND had a higher SI than MD and NM. CONCLUSIONS: The use of a 
      stabilization device can improve the quality of CPR and posture stability during 
      ambulance transportation, although the effects on the severity of back pain were 
      not significant.

AB  - We designed and built a non-invasive instrument, called Vertebral Metrics, to 
      measure the x, y, and z positions of each spinous process of the spine on a 
      standing position. In the present study, we perform a comparative evaluation of 
      Vertebral Metrics, by comparing the results obtained from this instrument with 
      those from a validated optoelectronic system of stereophotogrammetry, with 10 
      infrared cameras. The sample was composed of 11 women aged between 14 and 39 
      years. After marking the various points on the spinal column, from the first 
      cervical vertebra to the first sacral vertebra, they were measured first with the 
      new instrument (Vertebral Metrics) and then by means of the optoelectronics 
      system. Afterwards, the results were subjected to a thorough comparison. The 
      statistical comparison of the results was performed using an ANOVA model with 
      three factors (Instrument, Subject, and Vertebra) for the intervertebral 
      distance.

LID - 10.3233/BMR-2010-0259 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSES: To investigate the responses of the craniovertebral (CV) angle to 
      backpack loadings in adolescents with and without neck pain and to explore the 
      relationships between CV angle, relative backpack weight, neck pain and 
      disability. METHODS: A cross-sectional single-blinded study was conducted on 60 
      adolescents (30 neck pain and 30 non-neck pain) aged from 13 to 18 years old. The 
      verbal analog scale (VAS) and Chinese version of Northwick Park Neck Pain 
      Questionnaire (NPQ) were used to assess neck pain severity and disability 
      respectively. CV angle was measured in neutral and with backpack loadings of 5% 
      to 30% of subject's body weight by using the Head Posture Spinal Curvature 
      Instrument (HPSCI). RESULTS: In both groups, CV angles gradually decreased with 
      increment of backpack loadings and the amount of decreases became significant 
      from 10% body weight onwards (P < 0.05). Although the changes of CV angles did 
      not show any significant differences at any point of comparison between the 
      groups, the neck pain group showed a clinically significant decrease of CV angle 
      (∼ 5°) at 10% relative loading whereas non-neck pain group did it at 15% relative 
      loading. Change of CV angles did not show significant correlations with relative 
      backpack weight, cervical pain and disability (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our 
      findings suggested a safety limit of 10% relative backpack load for adolescents. 
      The results showed the tendency that the ability of maintaining good head posture 
      in response to backpack loadings by non-neck pain subjects might be better than 
      those with neck pain.

AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective radiographic analysis of lumbar spine range of motion 
      (ROM) after monosegmental fusion and posterior dynamic stabilization at the level 
      L4-L5. OBJECTIVE: Comparison of segmental ROM at the index level and the cranial 
      and caudal adjacent levels and of global lumbar spine ROM after monosegmental 
      fusion and posterior dynamic stabilization. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The 
      postulated advantage of nonfusion technology compared with fusion is based on the 
      assumption that preservation of motion at the treated segment reduces the 
      incidence of adjacent segment effects. Therefore, it is imperative to provide 
      evidence that dynamic stabilization devices avoid hypermobility at the adjacent 
      segments because this might substantiate a protective effect on the adjacent 
      segments. METHODS: Twenty-six patients with low back pain and claudication due to 
      degenerative instability at the level L4-L5 with concomitant spinal stenosis were 
      treated either with decompression and Dynesys (n = 11) or with decompression and 
      fusion (n = 15). All patients underwent flexion/extension radiographs before 
      surgery and at latest follow-up. ROM was assessed at the index level (L4-L5), the 
      cranial/caudal adjacent levels (L3-L4/L5-S1), and at the lumbar spine from L2 to 
      S1. RESULTS: There was a significant reduction of the global ROM of the lumbar 
      spine (L2-S1) and the segmental ROM at the index level (L4-L5) in the fusion 
      group, whereas adjacent level ROM did not change significantly. In the Dynesys 
      group, no significant changes of global lumbar spine ROM (L2-S1) and segmental 
      ROM (index level and cranial/caudal adjacent levels) were seen. CONCLUSION: This 
      study shows that neither monosegmental instrumented fusion nor monosegmental 
      posterior dynamic stabilization with Dynesys alter the ROM of the cranial and 
      caudal adjacent levels. Consequently, monosegmental posterior dynamic 
      stabilization with Dynesys has no effect with regard to adjacent segment mobility 
      compared with monosegmental fusion.

AB  - The final collapse of a "stable" thoracolumbar burst fracture is difficult to 
      predict. This collapse was prospectively studied radiologically in patients with 
      T12 or L1 burst fractures who, after evaluating the admission x-rays and the CT 
      scan with the patients themselves, opted for a rigid thoracolumbar brace with 
      support in the sternal manubrium (TLSO). On the other hand, patients with rigid 
      braces sometimes have low back pain on follow-up (due to overload of the L5-S1 
      joints). HYPOTHESIS: the standing lateral x-ray with only a TLSO for support 
      (intrinsic mechanical stability) provides information on the final collapse and 
      could also provide information on the low back pain. The study included 50 
      patients (20 males and 30 females, age: 63+14 years) admitted during 2011 and 
      2012, with 2 losses to follow-up. VARIABLES: Farcy index and local kyphosis (Cobb 
      at 3 vertebrae). X-Rays: admission, with TLSO (immediate: Rx0), and at 3 and 6 
      months. They were compared with the final clinical and radiological results. It 
      was decided to surgically intervene in 4 patients after Rx0. There were no 
      painful sequelae at the fracture level, and 16/44 (31%) had low back pain. Using 
      linear regression mathematical models, the increase in the Farcy index (Rx0-Rx 
      admission) was associated with the appearance of low back pain and with local 
      kyphosis (Rx0-Rx admission), and with the final kyphosis. It is advisable to 
      perform a lateral standing X-ray after TLSO for information on the final collapse 
      of the fracture and the appearance of accompanying low back pain.

AB  - PURPOSES: To investigate the responses of the craniovertebral (CV) angle to 
      backpack loadings in adolescents with and without neck pain and to explore the 
      relationships between CV angle, relative backpack weight, neck pain and 
      disability. METHODS: A cross-sectional single-blinded study was conducted on 60 
      adolescents (30 neck pain and 30 non-neck pain) aged from 13 to 18 years old. The 
      verbal analog scale (VAS) and Chinese version of Northwick Park Neck Pain 
      Questionnaire (NPQ) were used to assess neck pain severity and disability 
      respectively. CV angle was measured in neutral and with backpack loadings of 5% 
      to 30% of subject's body weight by using the Head Posture Spinal Curvature 
      Instrument (HPSCI). RESULTS: In both groups, CV angles gradually decreased with 
      increment of backpack loadings and the amount of decreases became significant 
      from 10% body weight onwards (P < 0.05). Although the changes of CV angles did 
      not show any significant differences at any point of comparison between the 
      groups, the neck pain group showed a clinically significant decrease of CV angle 
      ( approximately 5 degrees ) at 10% relative loading whereas non-neck pain group 
      did it at 15% relative loading. Change of CV angles did not show significant 
      correlations with relative backpack weight, cervical pain and disability (P > 
      0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggested a safety limit of 10% relative 
      backpack load for adolescents. The results showed the tendency that the ability 
      of maintaining good head posture in response to backpack loadings by non-neck 
      pain subjects might be better than those with neck pain.

      subjects with chronic low back pain.
PG  - 9-15
LID - 10.1002/pri.1589 [doi]
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: The study design is a case control study. OBJECTIVES: The objective 
      of this study is to evaluate how chronic low back pain (CLBP) affects the 
      performance of Star Excursion Balance Test (SEBT). BACKGROUND: Chronic low back 
      pain is associated with paraspinal and other trunk muscle weakness and reduction 
      in coordination of low back muscles. This reduction in muscular strength and 
      coordination contributes to decreased postural stability, balance and 
      neuromuscular control in subjects with CLBP. SEBT is a simple, reliable and valid 
      method of dynamic performance and is an alternative to more sophisticated 
      instrumented methods. However, no study has evaluated the effect of SEBT on CLBP 
      patients. METHODS AND MEASURES: Ten patients with CLBP (localized back pain, 
      lasting more than 6 months and radiating no further than the buttock with normal 
      neurological examination) and 10 normal age and sex matched subjects (mean age 
      34.30 + 8.67(range 22-50) participated in this study. All participants completed 
      the SEBT on their dominant leg, and distance measures were collected and compared 
      between groups. RESULTS: The dependant variable was analysed using independent 
      t-test with p < 0.05. The CLBP group demonstrated significant reductions in 
      excursion distances for all directions of the SEBT compared with the control 
      group, except for the posterior (P) direction (0.281) CONCLUSION: Star Excursion 
      Balance Test is an effective and simple tool to identify and measure reach 
      deficits in patients with CLBP. We recommend using SEBT as an outcome measure to 
      identify dynamic balance, multi-planar excursion and postural control in patients 
      with CLBP.

AB  - The amount of spontaneous movement during seated office work was estimated by 
      analysing the tilting movements of a tiltable office chair. Both movement 
      frequency and amplitude range were considered. The seat inclinations and 
      subjective acceptability were also recorded. The seat was moved more frequently 
      and with a greater range when adjusted 6 cm above popliteal level compared to 1 
      cm below, or when the backrest was pushed anteriorly or posteriorly compared to a 
      middle position. The greatest acceptability occurred with the highest seat 
      adjustment and the backrest in the middle position. Typing or desk-work 
      influenced movement to a similar extent.

TI  - Case report: Physical therapy management of axial dystonia.
PG  - 56-61
LID - 10.3109/09593985.2013.799252 [doi]
AB  - Few studies have described physical therapy approaches to provide functional 
      independence and reduce pain in individuals with dystonia. This report describes 
      the physical therapy treatment of a 46-year-old woman diagnosed with idiopathic 
      segmental axial dystonia. For two years, the patient was treated with 
      kinesiotherapy (active and resisted movements and stretching of neck and trunk 
      muscles), abdominal taping (kinesiotaping techniques), functional training, and 
      sensory tricks. She was assessed with parts I, II and III of Toronto Western 
      Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale (TWSTRS-I, TWSTRS-II and TWSTRS-III), Berg 
      Balance Scale (BBS), Six-Minute Walk Test (6-MWT), and the motor domain of 
      Functional Independence Measure (FIM-motor) before and after the two-year 
      treatment and after the one year follow-up. Postural control and symmetry 
      improved (TWSTRS-I: from 30 to 18), functional independence increased (TWSTRS-II: 
      from 27 to 15; BBS: from 36 to 46; 6-MWT: from 0 to 480 meters (m); FIM-motor: 
      from 59 to 81), and the pain diminished (TWSTRS-III: from 12 to 5). The 
      functional improvement was retained after one year (TWSTRS-I: 14/35; TWRTRS-II: 
      12/30; TWRTRS-III: 5/20; BBS: 48/56; 6-MWT: 450 m; FIM-motor: 81/91). This 
      program showed efficacy on providing a better control of the dystonic muscles and 
      thus the doses of botulinum toxin needed to treat them could be reduced. Outcomes 
      support the therapeutic strategies used to deal with this type of dystonia.

TI  - [Assessing the outcome of a back school program for the prevention of chronic 
      pain by behavioral observation-methodology and evaluation.].
PG  - 113-21
AB  - Sixteen experienced and 15 inexperienced observers watched videotapes showing 
      participants of a back school program perform simple tasks to assess the 
      functional adequacy of their posture. They had received basis or more extensive 
      observer training. Intraclass correlation coefficients were computed as a measure 
      of intra-and interobserver reliability. When individual judgments were compared, 
      it was found that the judgments of the experienced observers were more reliable 
      than those of the inexperienced observers. The additional observers training did 
      not lead to a significant augmentation of reliability. By selecting the most 
      reliable items two alternative measures of overall posture were constructured 
      whose reliability coefficients ranged fromr=0.89 to 0.93 for the group of 
      experienced observers. The reliability of the judgments by the more extensively 
      trained inexperienced observers was also satisfactory. The observation method 
      presented here can thus be regarded as a reliable and potentially valid 
      instrument for assessing the outcome of back school programs.

TI  - Evaluation of the threshold of stability for the human spine.
PG  - 1017-22
LID - 10.1016/j.jbiomech.2009.02.008 [doi]
AB  - The threshold of stability (ToS) is introduced as a new tool for evaluating 
      spinal stability. Current methods have evaluated the magnitude of spinal 
      kinematic variability, stability diffusion, or Lyapunov exponents. This present 
      method differs by modifying task difficulty to obtain a critical value 
      delineating regions of stability and instability. Conceptually, as task 
      difficulty increases, kinematic variability of the system increases and the basin 
      of stability decreases. When kinematic variability exceeds the basin of 
      stability, stability cannot be maintained over time. This concept is first 
      illustrated using a mathematical model, from which an effective potential 
      function was calculated to show the relationships among kinematic variability, 
      the basin of stability, and task difficulty. In addition, an experiment was 
      performed to evaluate the sensitivity of the ToS to changes in postural control 
      using visual feedback as a control variable. The ToS was found to be more 
      sensitive than the Lyapunov exponent to removal of visual feedback, suggesting it 
      may have use as a diagnostic indicator (e.g. for low back pain). Furthermore, 
      this new method has an additional advantage in which minimal instrumentation is 
      needed. Its simplicity, sensitivity, and low cost suggest that the ToS has 
      potential as a diagnostic or prognostic tool in a clinical setting.

TI  - [Ultrasonic Quantification of spinal configuration and postural capacity for 
      evaluation of different muscle strengthening programs in the therapy of back 
      pain].
PG  - 79-85
AB  - AIM: The aim of this study was the evaluation of the effectiveness of different 
      muscle strengthening programs in the therapy of back pain. METHODS: 102 male 
      longshoremen aged from 29 to 63 years with chronic back pain since > two years, 
      matched by pain intensity and functional limitations, were randomized to three 
      test groups (TG) and one control group (CG). The test persons carried out a 
      program for intensified muscle strengthening over a period of six months one to 
      two times weekly in a therapeutic practice (TG1), in a health club (TG2) and in a 
      gymnastic group (TG3). The CG did not complete any intervention. Ultrasound 
      topometry for recording spinal configuration and postural capacity as well as the 
      determination of pain intensity and functional limitations were used as 
      instruments of assessment. RESULTS: The data obtained for the CG remained 
      virtually unchanged over the period of investigation. In contrast a decrease of 
      pain intensity and functional limitations could be proved for all TG. 
      Furthermore, the training programs induced both an improved postural capacity 
      while performing the arm-raising test and an increasingly erect sagittal spinal 
      profile. The power of effectiveness was on a homogeneous level for the medical 
      training therapy (0.41), the fitness training (0.4) and the spinal gymnastics 
      (0.41). CONCLUSION: The three muscle strengthening programs investigated have 
      equally favorable effects on the parameters evaluated and are qualified as 
      effective strategies in the therapy for chronic spinal discomforts.

TI  - Evaluation of the relationship between laboratory and clinical tests of 
      transversus abdominis function.
PG  - 30-40
AB  - A clinical test of the function of the deep abdominal muscles was compared to a 
      laboratory electromyographic (EMG) investigation of the contribution of 
      transversus abdominis (TrA) to stability of the lumbar spine during limb 
      movement. The two different functions of TrA were evaluated in 15 subjects. The 
      subject group included six subjects with chronic low back pain and nine subjects 
      with no history of low back pain so that the resultant recordings were spread 
      over a wide range for each test. The clinical test involved quantification of the 
      ability of the subjects to specifically displace the anterior abdominal wall in a 
      way consistent with the function of the muscle. This was evaluated by use of a 
      device designed to measure pressure reduction as the abdomen lifted off a 
      transducer in the prone position. The laboratory test involved determination of 
      the onset of contraction of TrA associated with rapid upper limb movement, 
      measured using fine-wire EMG electrodes. The parameter evaluated was the latency 
      between the contraction of TrA and the prime mover of the limb. Data were 
      analysed both as absolute values and as ordinal data of a three-rating scale 
      derived from criteria based on current knowledge of the response to both tests. 
      No significant correlation was found between the absolute magnitudes of the 
      pressure and timing data, however, comparison of the rating scale data indicated 
      a significant relationship between the tests and associated high level of 
      agreement between the two measures. The results of the study indicate that a 
      reduction in the ability to draw in the abdominal wall is related to changes in 
      the coordination of TrA, although the magnitude of the changes were not 
      correlated. The degree of causality between these co-varying but independent 
      manifestations of the function of TrA is uncertain.

TI  - Spinal cord stimulation for the treatment of abnormal posture and gait disorder 
      in patients with Parkinson's disease.
PG  - 470-4
AB  - Patients with advanced Parkinson's disease (PD) often present with axial 
      symptoms, including abnormal posture, postural instability, and gait disorder. 
      Although spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is effective for pain, little is known 
      about the effect of SCS on motor function in PD patients. The present study 
      investigated the effect of SCS on posture and gait in 15 PD patients, 5 men and 
      10 women aged 63-79 years (mean 71.1 years), with low back pain and leg pain who 
      received SCS. A visual analog scale (VAS) was used for pain evaluation pre- and 
      postoperatively. The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, Timed Up and Go 
      tests, and Timed 10-Meter Walk tests were used to evaluate motor function and 
      activities of daily living of patients. Preoperative mean VAS score was 8.9 
      (range 7.8-10), which showed significant postoperative improvement at 3 months to 
      mean VAS score of 2.0 (range 0-3.3). The improvements in VAS scores persisted at 
      12 months after surgery with mean VAS score of 2.3 (range 0-4). Posture and 
      postural stability motor subscores were improved at 3 months after SCS, and gait 
      had significantly improved at 3 months and 1 year after surgery. Timed 10-Meter 
      Walk tests also demonstrated that patient gait was significantly improved at 3 
      months and 12 months after surgery. Most advanced stage PD patients suffer 
      considerable pain that causes abnormal posture and gait disturbance. SCS is 
      expected to lead to both amelioration of pain and improvement of motor function 
      in such patients.

TI  - A randomized clinical trial of manual versus mechanical force manipulation in the 
      treatment of sacroiliac joint syndrome.
PG  - 493-501
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of instrument-delivered compared with 
      traditional manual-delivered thrust chiropractic adjustments in the treatment of 
      sacroiliac joint syndrome. METHODS: Prospective, randomized, comparative clinical 
      trial. Sixty patients with sacroiliac syndrome were randomized into two groups of 
      30 subjects. Each subject received 4 chiropractic adjustments over a 2-week 
      period and was evaluated at 1-week follow-up. One group received side-posture, 
      high-velocity, low-amplitude chiropractic adjustments; the other group received 
      mechanical-force, manually-assisted chiropractic adjustments using an Activator 
      Adjusting Instrument (Activator Methods International, Ltd, Phoenix, Ariz). 
      RESULTS: No significant differences between groups were noted at the initial 
      consultation for any of the outcome variables. Statistically significant 
      improvements were observed in both groups from the first to third, third to 
      fifth, and first to fifth consultations for improvements (P < .001) in mean 
      numerical pain rating scale 101 (group 1, 49.1-23.4; group 2, 48.9-22.5), revised 
      Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire (group 1, 37.4-18.5; group 2, 
      36.6-15.1), orthopedic rating score (group 1, 7.6-0.6; group 2, 7.5-0.8), and 
      algometry measures (group 1, 4.8-6.5; group 2, 5.0-6.8) for first to last visit 
      for both groups. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that a short regimen of either 
      mechanical-force, manually-assisted or high-velocity, low-amplitude chiropractic 
      adjustments were associated with a beneficial effect of a reduction in pain and 
      disability in patients diagnosed with sacroiliac joint syndrome. Neither 
      mechanical-force, manually-assisted nor high-velocity, low-amplitude adjustments 
      were found to be more effective than the other in the treatment of this patient 
      population.

TI  - Postural post-dural puncture headache after spinal and epidural anaesthesia. A 
      randomised, double-blind study.
PG  - 759-64
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study was conducted in order to investigate the effect of 
      patient expectation in the development of postural post-dural puncture headache 
      (PPDPH). METHODS: 224 patients less than 55 years scheduled for minor 
      non-obstetric surgery were randomised to receive single-injection spinal (SA) or 
      epidural (EA) anaesthesia. A 27-g Quinke needle was used for SA and a 18-g Tuohy 
      needle for EA. Patients, operating team and postoperative ward personnel were all 
      blinded to the anaesthetic given and so was an independent observer responsible 
      for follow-up after 5-7 days. The occurrence of headache, backache and other 
      complaints was recorded. Headache was classified as PPDPH or non-PPDPH, and 
      duration and intensity of the headache was registered. The quality of anaesthesia 
      was directly evaluated by the surgeon using a VAS scale from 1 (excellent) to 10 
      (very poor) and indirectly by the supplemental use of opioid analgesia and 
      general anaesthesia in the two groups. RESULTS: 212 patients, 103 SA and 109 EA, 
      with a mean age of 36.7 years, could be fully evaluated. The groups were 
      comparable with regards to age, sex and surgical procedure performed. Headache 
      occurred in 44 patients postoperatively. PPDPH was diagnosed in 16 patients 
      (15.5%) in the SA group and 2 (1.8%) in the EA group (P = 0.0014). Non-PPDPH 
      occurred in 13 patients in each group. PPDPH had significantly greater mean 
      intensity and duration than non-PPHPH. More patients in the EA group had 
      postoperative backache (31.2%) than in the SA group (22.3%), but this difference 
      was not statistically significant. More patients in the EA received general 
      anaesthesia and opioid analgesia than in the SA group, and the surgeon's rating 
      was on average 1.3 in the SA group compared to 2.5 in the EA group (P = 0.0003). 
      CONCLUSIONS: SA gave more headache but superior quality of surgical anaesthesia 
      compared with EA. Dural puncture, and not expectation, is the major cause of 
      PPDPH.

TI  - Some differences of the electromyographic erector spinae activity between normal 
      subjects and low back pain patients during the generation of isometric trunk 
      torque.
PG  - 495-9
AB  - A method of evaluation of the isometric trunk extension effort and integrated 
      electromyographic activity of the low back muscles during straight position under 
      goniometric control was used. In order to evaluate the paravertebral muscle 
      activity, two pairs of bipolar surface EMG electrodes have been attached 
      bilaterally over the erector spinae muscles at a lateral distance of 3 cm at the 
      level of L3 spinal processus. 40 patients with low back pain and 40 normals were 
      involved to participate in this study. EMG activity and strength was higher in 
      normals than in patients. However, this distinction was statistical significant 
      in strength, and nonsignificant in EMG activity. Patients showed relatively 
      higher, asymmetric and more expressive in the painful side integrated 
      electromyographic activity under maximal and submaximal contraction. Strength/EMS 
      relationship was close to linear in normals, whereas in patients this 
      proportionality was nonlinear. Therefore in patients a smaller tension correlated 
      with relatively higher muscle activity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Back pain is a common cause of sick leave in industrialized 
      countries. Performing surgery is often associated with considerable cervical 
      spine disorders. However, only a few studies have examined to what extent working 
      posture or individual surgical techniques can be seen as stress indicators. 
      MATERIAL AND METHODS: Posture and movement of the spine and trunk were assessed 
      by means of a newly developed analysis system (3-D-SMG). The individual-case 
      study was carried out during six sinus operations using varying techniques 
      (microscope, endoscope or headlamp only). RESULTS: Spine and trunk deviation from 
      neutral position (upright standing) was strongest in the sagittal plane. Awkward 
      distortions were primarily observed in the cervical and lumbar spine. The 
      analysis of work characteristics revealed static postures in 65-90% of sinus 
      operations. Isometric positions were mainly related to microscopic surgery. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The data from this explorative individual-case study indicate that 
      prevalence and magnitude of forced isometric and awkward postures are strongly 
      associated with work-related spinal stress in sinus surgery. The new measurement 
      device enables not only the recommendation of individual preventive strategies 
      but also the objective evaluation of ergonomics.

TI  - [The posturological clinic evaluation in vdt/pc operators: a second level 
      diagnostic instrument in low back pain evaluation].
PG  - 303-4
AB  - The diagnosis and the therapy of the cases of low back pain in absence of organic 
      spinal column diseases, frequently referred by vdt/pc users in connection with 
      their work activities are frequently unsatisfactory both for the Occupational 
      Doctors and for the patients. The specialized posturological evaluation, composed 
      by a specific clinical examination and by specific instrumental exams, seems to 
      be a valid instrument for a more effective management of patients affected by 
      such clinical cases. The treatments described in this research have eliminated or 
      greatly reduced the pain in these patients, with an efficacy prolonged until at 
      least a year; as it is demonstrated by the few relapses referred by the workers. 
      We think that a more frequent cooperation between Occupational Doctors and 
      Posturologists can improve both the clinical conditions of the patients and the 
      possibilities they have in the years to maintain their complete work ability.

TI  - Continuous assessment of low back loads in long-term care nurses.
PG  - 1108-16
LID - 10.1080/00140139.2010.502253 [doi]
AB  - Considerable effort has been spent evaluating aspects of low back injury risk in 
      nursing yet comprehensive evaluation of all work tasks has been limited. The 
      purpose of this study was to evaluate peak and cumulative lumbar spine loads 
      experienced by personal support workers. A total of 20 female long-term care 
      workers were observed and had trunk posture monitored via an inclinometer 
      throughout their shift. When adjusted for an 8-h workday, workers experienced 
      cumulative loads of 21.3 +/- 4.6 MNs, 1.8 +/- 0.6 MNs and 2.9 +/- 1.4 MNs for 
      compression, lateral and anterior shear, respectively. Patient care, unloaded 
      standing, walking and miscellaneous tasks accounted for almost 80% of cumulative 
      compression, while lifts and transfers accounted for less than 10%. Mechanical 
      lift assists reduced peak loads and contributed minimally to cumulative loading. 
      These findings suggest that both peak and cumulative spine loads should be 
      considered when evaluating injury risk in the nursing profession. STATEMENT OF 
      RELEVANCE: This study has shown that tasks other than patient transfers and lifts 
      are important in the assessment of low back injury risk in nurses. The method 
      developed is a relatively straightforward approach that can be used to estimate 
      peak and cumulative spine load to provide insight to risk of injury in many 
      occupational settings.

TI  - Evaluation of an action research project in ophthalmic nursing practice.
PG  - 389-98
AB  - AIM: This paper reports the evaluation phase of an action research project that 
      promoted face-down posturing of patients following vitreo-retinal surgery for 
      macular hole to enhance patient outcomes. The evaluation phase identified areas 
      of practice needing further development from the perspectives of those involved 
      with the care of patients. BACKGROUND: To achieve best results following surgical 
      repair of macular hole, patients are required to posture face down for several 
      weeks. As a consequence, patients complain of severe back and neck ache and find 
      it difficult to persist with the posturing. Work to advance nursing practice as 
      surgical developments occur has relevance beyond ophthalmology and the particular 
      context of this project. METHOD: The first three phases of this action 
      research--problem identification, planning and action--have been reported in 
      another paper. Throughout the project an action research group comprising of 
      representatives of key stakeholders were actively involved in researching and 
      changing practice. During the evaluation phase, a qualitative methodology was 
      chosen. Interviews with 17 members of staff from the inpatient area were carried 
      out to elicit their perspectives on the posturing of patients. Qualitative 
      interviews were selected to facilitate comparison with interview data from Phase 
      1. Data analysis ran concurrently with data collection, so that one could inform 
      the other. FINDINGS: Overall, nurses and healthcare support workers felt that 
      patients were more agreeable to posturing and after surgery began to posture more 
      quickly. Communication was still an issue in some instances, and patients having 
      urgent as opposed to planned surgery were found to be more difficult to prepare 
      and the psychological care of patients still posed problems for nursing staff. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The evaluation suggests that improvements in the care of this group 
      of patients have occurred. A 10-point plan to promote face-down posturing has 
      been developed which will be of use to practitioners in other settings. Some 
      aspects of practice remain less well-understood, for example, the psychological 
      care of patients.

TI  - Validation of postural radiographs as a way to measure change in pelvic 
      obliquity.
PG  - 75-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the validity of using postural radiographs to assess 
      change in pelvic obliquity. DESIGN: Blinded comparison of reference lines and 
      instrument development of postural radiographs. SETTING: Veterans Administration 
      hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-nine subjects with no history of low back pain. 
      INTERVENTION: Repeated postural radiographs without heel lifts and with (1/4)-in 
      (6.35-mm) and (1/2)-in (12.7-mm) heel lifts. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The change of 
      pelvic obliquity as measured by the intersulcate, interalar, and sacral surface 
      lines on postural radiographs. RESULTS: A (1/4)-in heel lift resulted in changes 
      of 4.6+/-4.0mm, 3.6+/-3.1mm, and 5.8+/-3.9mm and a (1/2)-in heel lift in changes 
      of 7.8+/-4.3mm, 7.8+/-4.6mm, and 5.2+/-3.8mm for the intersulcate, interalar, and 
      sacral surface lines, respectively. Pearson correlation coefficients were used to 
      correlate the change in pelvic obliquity with the corresponding heights of heel 
      lifts; for the (1/4)-in heel lift, they were.67,.88, and.71, and for (1/2)-in 
      heel lift they were.73,.79, and.87 for the intersulcate, interalar, and sacral 
      surface lines, respectively (all P<.001). CONCLUSION: All the reference lines 
      seem to be valid measures of change of pelvic obliquity relative to the size of 
      the lifts (ie, the changes in pelvic obliquity seem to be causally related and 
      correlated with the lifts). These results also suggest that postural radiographs 
      can be used to determine the magnitude of pelvic obliquity.

TI  - Auto-traction for treatment of lumbago-sciatica. A multicentre controlled 
      investigation.
PG  - 791-8
AB  - In this controlled prospective study of the Auto-traction method for the 
      treatment of lumbago-sciatica, 82 patients were randomly allocated to either 
      treatment with Auto-traction for up to three 1-hour sessions in 1 week, or they 
      were given a corset and advised to rest. The orthopaedic surgeons participating 
      in the study worked at six different hospitals and all had limited experience of 
      the Auto-traction method obtained during a 1-week course. All patients were 
      clinically evaluated by an independent observer who also performed the follow-up 
      examinations 1 and 3 weeks after the treatment sessions. In addition a 3-month 
      follow-up was performed by letter. The Auto-traction method gave prompt relief of 
      pain and a normalizing of the SLR test more often than treatment with only a 
      corset and rest. The difference between the two treatment groups was 
      statistically significant. The immediate difference noted between the treatment 
      groups had decreased slightly at 3 weeks but was still statistically significant 
      at this time.

TI  - Circumferential and posterolateral fusion for lumbar disc disease.
PG  - 114-23
AB  - Clinical outcome of low back fusion is unpredictable. There are various reports 
      discussing the merits and clinical outcome of these two procedures. The patients 
      were selected from a population of patients who had chronic low back pain 
      unresponsive to conservative treatment. Thirty-six instrumented posterolateral 
      fusions and 35 instrumented circumferential fusions with posterior lumbar 
      interbody fusions were done simultaneously. Preoperative radiographic assessment 
      included plain radiographs, magnetic resonance imaging scans, and provocative 
      discography in all the patients. Posterolateral fusion or anterior lumbar 
      interbody fusion was done for internal disc disruption. The Oswestry disability 
      index, subjective scoring, and assessment of fusion were done at a minimum 
      followup of 2 years. On subjective scoring assessment there was a satisfactory 
      outcome of 63.9% (23 patients) in the posterolateral fusion group and 82.8% (29 
      patients) in the posterior lumbar interbody fusion group. On assessment by the 
      Oswestry index no difference was found in outcome between the two groups. The 
      posterolateral fusion group had a 63.9% satisfactory outcome and the posterior 
      lumbar interbody fusion group had an 80% satisfactory outcome using the Oswestry 
      disability index for postoperative assessment. There was 61.1% improvement in 
      working ability in the posterolateral fusion group and 77.1% improvement in the 
      posterior lumbar interbody fusion group which was not statistically significant. 
      The authors consider instrumented circumferential fusion with posterior lumbar 
      interbody fusion better than instrumented posterolateral fusion for managing 
      chronic disabling low back pain.

TI  - Combined epidural/spinal anaesthesia: needle-through-needle or separate spaces?
PG  - 854-7
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: This prospective, randomized and blinded study compared 
      the performance of a new needle-through-needle (NTN) kit (Epistar; Medimex, 
      Germany) with the double-space technique for providing combined spinal epidural 
      anaesthesia during Caesarean section. METHODS: Following local Ethics Committee 
      approval and patient consent, 200 females were randomized to receive combined 
      spinal epidural anaesthesia by the double-space (n = 100) or NTN (n = 100) 
      technique. The frequency with which the intrathecal component could achieve a T5 
      block to touch for Caesarean section without the need for epidural augmentation 
      or an alternative technique was determined. The time from start of procedure to 
      achieving a block height to T5 was recorded. Pain and backache at insertion, and 
      at 24 h follow-up were recorded using a visual analogue scale. To remove any bias 
      due to posture, 50% of each group were further randomized to receive their block 
      in the sitting or in the left lateral position. To evaluate improvement of 
      performance over time the success in the first 100 study patients were compared 
      to the success in the second 100. RESULTS: A successful block to T5 with the 
      double-space and NTN techniques were 80 vs. 54, odds ratio 0.29. Failure to enter 
      the intrathecal space once the epidural space had been located occurred in 29 
      patients in the NTN group. Time to readiness for surgery was 15 min (95% 
      confidence interval (CI): 12.7-17.4) and 12.9 min (95% CI: 11.5-14.3) for the 
      double-space and NTN techniques, respectively. The median (interquartile range) 
      visual analogue scores for discomfort at insertion were 30 (12.5-51.5) and 32 
      (12.75-60) and for postoperative backache 0 (0-10) and 0 (0-10.75) in the 
      double-space and NTN groups, respectively. The number of epidural augmentations 
      was similar in both the groups and posture made no difference. There was a 
      tendency to increased success in the second half of the study. CONCLUSION: The 
      double-space technique had a greater success rate than the NTN technique.

TI  - Laboratory evaluation of belt usage with apple buckets.
PG  - 23-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Migrant and seasonal orchard harvest workers experience 
      musculoskeletal strain caused by carrying heavy loads and holding awkward 
      postures. An ergonomic hip belt designed to redistribute weight from the upper 
      back, neck, and shoulders to the hips was evaluated. METHODS: A comparison of 
      muscle exertion (using electromyography [EMG]) of four key back and shoulder 
      muscles and shoulder surface pressure (using a surface pressure sensor [PS]) was 
      made among 10 laboratory volunteers under intervention and control conditions, in 
      two postures (standing erect [0 degrees ]) and flexed [45 degrees ]). RESULTS: 
      All but one measure showed a significant reduction in the flexed posture with the 
      intervention. Two of eight measures showed a significant reduction in the erect 
      posture. Correlations with shoulder discomfort were found for deep shoulder EMG 
      (r=0.71, P=0.021) and shoulder surface pressure (r=0.58, P=0.082). CONCLUSIONS: 
      The hip belt intervention produces significant reductions in muscle activity 
      while in a posture commonly assumed during orchard work.

TI  - Whole-body vibration and health effects in the agricultural machinery drivers.
PG  - 127-32
AB  - Recently farm mechanization has been widespread and developing rapidly, in 
      particular riding farm machines are increasingly used in paddy fields in Japan. 
      We have no information available on the actual situation regarding whole-body 
      vibration on the seats of these farm machines from the standpoint of labour 
      protection. Measurement and evaluation of whole-body vibration was performed on 
      the seats of popular riding agricultural machineries. Whole-body vibration on the 
      seats of combine harvesters and wheel tractors exceeded exposure limits and the 
      fatigue-decreased proficiency boundary limit of 8 hr and also shortened the 
      reduced comfort boundary limits of ISO 2631 (1985). Some combines, tractors and 
      carieers had only less than one hour exposure duration as compared with the ISO 
      2631-1 standard (1997). On the other hand a questionnaire was also performed on 
      the subject of agricultural machine operators. Any specific injury or other 
      effects, i.e. low back injuries were not found among the group of operators as 
      compared with those in non-operator farmers. It seems to be difficult to find out 
      the health effects of whole-body vibration itself, because there may be a lot of 
      causes, i.e. working posture, operating heavy materials, in farm working 
      conditions.

TI  - Inversion therapy in patients with pure single level lumbar discogenic disease: a 
      pilot randomized trial.
PG  - 1473-80
LID - 10.3109/09638288.2011.647231 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Backache and sciatica due to protuberant disc disease is a major cause 
      of lost working days and health expenditure. Surgery is a well-established option 
      in the management flowchart. There is no strong evidence proving that traction 
      for sciatica is effective. We report a pilot prospective randomized controlled 
      trial comparing inversion traction and physiotherapy with standard physiotherapy 
      alone in patients awaiting lumbar disc surgery. This study sought to study the 
      feasibility of a randomized controlled trial on the effect of inversion therapy 
      in patients with single level lumbar discogenic disease, who had been listed for 
      surgery. METHODS: This was a single centre prospective randomized controlled 
      trial undertaken at the Regional Neurosciences Centre, Newcastle Upon Tyne, UK. 
      It was a prospective randomized controlled trial where patients awaiting surgery 
      for pure lumbar discogenic disease within the ambit of the prestated 
      inclusion/exclusion criteria were allocated to either physiotherapy or 
      physiotherapy and intermittent traction with an inversion device. Post-treatment 
      assessment made by blinded observers at 6 weeks for various outcome measures 
      included the Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ) Score, Short Form 36 
      (SF 36), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), Visual Analogue Pain Score (VAS), 
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) appearance and the need for surgery. Avoidance 
      of surgery was considered a treatment success. RESULTS: Twenty-six patients were 
      enrolled and 24 were randomized [13 to inversion + physiotherapy and 11 to 
      physiotherapy alone (control)]. Surgery was avoided in 10 patients (76.9%) in the 
      inversion group, whereas it was averted in only two patients (22.2%) in the 
      control group. Cancellation of the proposed operation was a clinical decision 
      based on the same criteria by which the patient was listed for surgery initially. 
      There were no significant differences in the RMDQ, SF 36, ODI, VAS or MRI results 
      between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Intermittent traction with an inversion 
      device resulted in a significant reduction in the need for surgery. A larger 
      multicentre prospective randomized controlled trial is justified in patients with 
      sciatica due to single level lumbar disc protrusions. [ IMPLICATIONS FOR 
      REHABILITATION: • Resolution of impairment and diasability due to radiculopathy 
      is the aim of any intervention.• Avoidance of surgery meant satisfactory 
      resolution of impairment and disability due to radiculopathy. This happened more 
      often in the inversion group to the extent of reaching statistical significance.• 
      The 12-point improvement in disability by the Oswestry Disability Index in the 
      inversion group suggests a role for this intervention in disability reduction.• 
      Inversion may form part of the conservative rehabilitation of patients with 
      single level unilateral lumbar disc protrusion alongside other forms of 
      physiotherapy.• There is a potential secondary impact in the reduction of 
      rehabilitation following surgery.]

TI  - A preliminary study to evaluate postural improvement in subjects with scoliosis: 
      active therapeutic movement version 2 device and home exercises using the 
      Mulligan's mobilization-with-movement concept.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this preliminary study was to determine if the use of 
      Active Therapeutic Movement Version 2 (ATM2) device and home exercises using the 
      Mulligan's mobilization-with-movement concept by subjects with scoliosis would 
      result in postural improvement and to document any changes in trunk range of 
      motion and quality of life. METHODS: Forty-three subjects between the ages of 12 
      to 75 years were recruited for the study. Each subject underwent a low back 
      evaluation along with specific measurements for their scoliosis. Subjects 
      participated in a 4-week intervention, 2 times a week consisting of treatment 
      utilizing the ATM2 and were also given a home exercise program to mimic the 
      specific movement(s) they performed on the ATM2. Photographic assessment of 
      posture was taken before and after the intervention. Subjects were surveyed 
      during the initial assessment and again at the final intervention using the 
      following outcome measures: Fear Avoidance Belief Questionnaire, Short-Form 
      Health Survey-36, Oswestry Disability Index, and a Numeric Pain Rating Scale. 
      RESULTS: Results were significant for most of the variables measured. Subjects 
      gained improvement in spinal ranges of motion for all directions except for 
      flexion and extension (most subjects had reference range of flexion and extension 
      at the beginning of the study). Most subjects had improved pelvic alignment after 
      the intervention. Before and after photographs demonstrated improved posture. 
      Subjective measurements of pain, disability, and quality of life improved. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Results of this preliminary study showed improvement for selected 
      variables. The use of ATM2 and home exercises using the Mulligan's 
      mobilization-with-movement concept by subjects with scoliosis appears to be a 
      potentially viable conservative treatment alternative to address various findings 
      associated with scoliosis, including posture improvement.

PG  - 779-83
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: A correlational design was used to compare the lumbar spine's total 
      sagittal range of motion (ROM) within a chronic low back pain patient population 
      (n = 42) using three different measurement systems. OBJECTIVES: To compare, 
      within a back pain patient population, the relationship of ROM measurements 
      obtained from a motion analysis system (SPINETRAK), a lumbar extension 
      rehabilitation device (MedX), and liquid inclinometers. METHODS: Total lumbar 
      sagittal ROM was determined with each device in each subject as part of patients' 
      standard clinical evaluation. RESULTS: Results indicated that the motion analysis 
      system is significantly correlated with the liquid inclinometers and mildly 
      correlated with the MedX. Inclinometer and MedX ROM measurements are also 
      significantly correlated. To assess individual differences, dependent t tests 
      were performed. Results indicated that the SPINETRAK yielded significantly lower 
      ROM than the inclinometer or the MedX. The MedX and inclinometer measures did not 
      significantly differ. CONCLUSIONS: This report shows that, depending on the 
      device and procedures used, the lumbar sagittal ROM within a chronic low back 
      pain population vary significantly.

TI  - Ambulatory accelerometry to quantify motor behaviour in patients after failed 
      back surgery: a validation study.
PG  - 153-61
AB  - In the treatment of patients with pain, measures related to (pain) behaviour are 
      of major importance. Ambulatory activity monitoring can be used to obtain insight 
      into actual behaviour. This study was designed to validate the Activity Monitor 
      (AM), an instrument based on long-term ambulatory monitoring of accelerometer 
      signals, to assess several physical activities during normal daily life. Ten 
      failed back surgery (FBS) patients performed a number of functional activities in 
      and around their own houses. During the measurements, continuous ambulatory 
      registrations of accelerometer signals were made, based on four body-mounted 
      accelerometers (one on each upper leg, two on the trunk). Video recordings made 
      simultaneously with the measurements were used as a reference. The continuous 
      output of the AM (postures, transitions, dynamic activities) was compared with 
      visual analysis of the videotapes. The overall results showed an agreement 
      between AM output and video analysis of 87% (inter subject range: 83-88%). The 
      maximal error in the determination of the duration of activities was 0.3%. The 
      overall number of dynamic periods was determined well (AM: 359; video: 368), 
      while the number of transitions was slightly overestimated (AM: 228; video: 205). 
      The results when using the three-sensor version of the AM were somewhat less 
      accurate (overall agreement from 87% to 82%). The AM appeared to be a valid 
      instrument to quantify aspects of behaviour of FPS patients, such as duration of 
      activities and number of transitions. This new technique of ambulatory 
      measurement of mobility activities seems to be a relevant and promising extension 
      of the techniques currently used in the evaluation of pain treatment.

TI  - Field evaluation of a modified intervention for overhead drilling.
PG  - 194-202
LID - 10.1080/15459620903558491 [doi]
AB  - Drilling holes into concrete or metal ceilings is one of the most physically 
      demanding tasks performed in construction. The work is done overhead with rotary 
      impact hammer drills that weigh up to 40 N. The task is associated with pain and 
      musculoskeletal disorders at the wrist, forearm, shoulder, and back. The 
      mechanism of injury is thought to be the high forces and non-neutral shoulder and 
      wrist postures applied during drilling. Previously, we described a field study of 
      a foot lever and inverted drill press intervention devices that received poor 
      usability ratings compared with the usual method for overhead drilling based on 
      problems with mobility and productivity. Using a participatory intervention 
      model, feedback from construction workers (N = 13) was used to develop a new 
      intervention design that incorporated a wheeled tripod base and a unique method 
      of aligning the drilling column to vertical. A different group of construction 
      workers (N = 23) evaluated usability and fatigue of the new device during their 
      regular overhead drilling in comparison with the usual method. Four of 12 
      usability ratings were significantly better with the intervention device compared 
      with the usual method. Subjective shoulder fatigue was less with the new 
      intervention (1.1 vs. 3.3; scale 0 to 5; p < 0.001). This difference was 
      supported by objective outcome measures; the mean hand forces during drilling 
      were 26 N with the intervention compared with 245 N with the usual method. The 
      percentage of time with the shoulder flexed or abducted to more than 60 degrees 
      was less with the intervention compared with the usual method (21 vs. 40%; p = 
      0.007). There was significantly less head extension with the intervention 
      compared with the usual method. There were no significant differences in overall 
      productivity between the two methods. This study demonstrates that a new 
      intervention device for overhead drilling has improved usability and subjective 
      fatigue ratings compared with the usual method. These improvements are most 
      likely due to the reduced hand forces, reduced shoulder abduction and flexion, 
      and reduced drilling time.

TI  - Instrumented posterior lumbar fusion outcomes for lumbar degenerative disorders 
      in a southern European, semirural population.
PG  - 444-50
LID - 10.1097/BSD.0b013e3181c9828e [doi]
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Prospective, clinical study. OBJECTIVE: This study compares the 
      preoperative and postoperative status of patients with degenerative lumbar spine 
      disorders, who underwent instrumented posterior lumbar fusion (IPLF), from the 
      functional, economic and psychologic perspectives in a semirural population. 
      SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: IPLF is a common procedure in the treatment of a more 
      common disorder, lumbar spine degeneration. It has been postulated that both the 
      disorder and the surgical procedure may affect many aspects of patients' life. 
      METHODS: During a 2 years period, 46 patients underwent IPLF for degenerative 
      disorders of the lumbar spine. The surgical procedure included posterior 
      decompression of the affected segment(s) and stabilization by means of pedicle 
      screws and rods in every case, and interbody implants in selected cases. The 
      outcome measures included the Greek versions of (a) Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) 
      for pain assessment, (b) Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) for back-related 
      disability, (c) Prolo Scale for the functional and economic status and (d) Zung 
      Depression Scale to screen for depression. Measurements were taken 1-week 
      preoperatively, and 3 years after the procedure. The comparison of the 
      preoperative and postoperative results was done using the paired-samples t test. 
      RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients (25 females, 14 males) with a mean age of 59 years 
      were eligible for our study. Half of them worked in the agricultural sector. All 
      developed solid, lumbar fusions. Instrumented posterior lumbar fusion decreased 
      patient's somatic pain, as shown by the VAS (P<0.001) and improved function as 
      indicated by the ODI (P<0.001), and allowed return to work (P<0.001). 
      Nevertheless, the Zung Depression Scale revealed that the incidence of depression 
      increased postoperatively (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: IPLF in the treatment of 
      degenerative disorders of the lumbar spine improves function and promotes the 
      patients' complete or partial return to work. In contrast, degenerative lumbar 
      spine disorders are chronic conditions and may negatively affect patients' 
      psychology.

TI  - Clinical evaluation of the BackMate lower lumbar rehabilitation system: results 
      of a preliminary study.
PG  - 185-90
AB  - Back pain profoundly affects daily activities and quality-of-life parameters. It 
      was the intent of the present study to evaluate a procedure of stretching and 
      strengthening the lower back musculature with the aid of a pelvic stabilization 
      device, the BackMate, for the treatment of lower back pain. Subjects suffering 
      from chronic back pain (> 3 months in duration) were studied. The treatment 
      program consisted of three therapy sessions per week for 3 weeks. Sitting time, 
      walking distance, and lower back pain, parameters reported by the subjects, 
      significantly improved regardless of age and sex of the subjects. Similarly, 
      objective parameters, including forward bend, straight leg raise, and hamstring 
      flexibility, significantly improved. This preliminary experience suggests that 
      stretching and strengthening procedures performed with the aid of a pelvic 
      stabilization device may prove to be a significant addition to current clinical 
      treatment procedures for lower back pain.

TI  - Development of kinematics tests for the evaluation of lumbar proprioception and 
      equilibration.
PG  - 612-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed at developing lumbar repositioning and seated 
      equilibration tests. DESIGN: 3D-electrogoniometric study of trunk repositioning 
      and equilibration in seated position. BACKGROUND: Postural equilibrium and lumbar 
      proprioception alterations have been shown in patients with low-back pain. 
      METHODS: In 21 healthy volunteers, pure flexion and flexion+rotation 
      repositioning error was measured using 3D-electrogoniometry. Lumbar kinematics 
      was analysed (time and frequency domain) during antero-posterior and lateral 
      equilibration tests in seated position. Reproducibility and stability of the 
      protocol were evaluated. RESULTS: Reproducibility and stability were good. Pure 
      flexion repositioning error was similar to previous reports. For flexion+rotation 
      tests, repositioning error was 3 degrees for flexion and 1 degrees for rotation. 
      Amplitude, imbalance time and power spectrum were significantly larger in lateral 
      than in antero-posterior equilibration tests. CONCLUSIONS: The feasibility of 
      kinematic analysis of lumbar repositioning and equilibration was shown. 
      Repositioning error values were in agreement with previous studies. New tests and 
      parameters were proposed. Lateral equilibration tests appeared more demanding 
      than antero-posterior tests. RELEVANCE: In patients with low-back pain, lumbar 
      repositioning and equilibration tests may be of use to define rehabilitation 
      strategies and to evaluate treatment outcome.

TI  - Reducing random measurement error in assessing postural load on the back in 
      epidemiologic surveys.
PG  - 15-23
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to design strategies to assess postural 
      load on the back in occupational epidemiology by taking into account the 
      reliability of measurement methods and the variability of exposure among the 
      workers under study. METHODS: Intermethod reliability studies were evaluated to 
      estimate the systematic bias (accuracy) and random measurement error (precision) 
      of various methods to assess postural load on the back. Intramethod reliability 
      studies were reviewed to estimate random variability of back load over time. 
      RESULTS: Intermethod surveys have shown that questionnaires have a moderate 
      reliability for gross activities such as sitting, whereas duration of trunk 
      flexion and rotation should be assessed by observation methods or inclinometers. 
      Intramethod surveys indicate that exposure variability can markedly affect the 
      reliability of estimates of back load if the estimates are based upon a single 
      measurement over a certain time period. Equations have been presented to evaluate 
      various study designs according to the reliability of the measurement method, the 
      optimum allocation of the number of repeated measurements per subject, and the 
      number of subjects in the study. CONCLUSION: Prior to a large epidemiologic 
      study, an exposure-oriented survey should be conducted to evaluate the 
      performance of measurement instruments and to estimate sources of variability for 
      back load. The strategy for assessing back load can be optimized by balancing the 
      number of workers under study and the number of repeated measurements per worker.

TI  - Preliminary study: reliability of the spinal wheel. A novel device to measure 
      spinal postures applied to sitting and standing.
PG  - 995-1003
LID - 10.1007/s00586-009-1241-0 [doi]
AB  - Postural re-education is an integral part of physiotherapy management in patients 
      with back pain. Although the link between posture and back pain is largely 
      unknown, postural re-education is performed on the premise of optimizing spinal 
      alignment to minimize stresses on the passive structures of the spine, to 
      facilitate optimal muscular support and thus to prevent possible damage and 
      further pain. A reliable and clinically meaningful measurement of spinal postures 
      to monitor such interventions remains challenging. This study evaluated 
      within-day (intra-tester, inter-tester) and between-day (test-retest) reliability 
      of a novel spinal wheel device measuring thoracic and lumbar postures during 
      sitting and standing. 17 healthy volunteers (age 39.5 +/- 5.4, BMI 25 +/- 9.2; 9 
      males) were measured three times, by three testers, on two separate occasions (1 
      week apart). The angular change between C7 and T12 and between T12 and S1 
      provided thoracic and lumbar curvatures, respectively. Intra-class correlation 
      coefficient (ICC) with 95% confidence intervals and typical error were 
      calculated. Excellent reliability was demonstrated with intra-tester ICCs between 
      0.947 and 0.980 and typical error between 1.7 degrees and 3.7 degrees and 
      inter-tester ICCs between 0.949 and 0.986 and typical error between 2.0 degrees 
      and 4.7 degrees. Test-retest reliability was high with ICCs 0.719-0.908 and 
      typical error between 4.0 degrees and 7.4 degrees. In conclusion, the spinal 
      wheel demonstrated excellent within-day and high between-day reliability. The 
      device may be used in conjunction with 2D camcorder to provide clinically useful 
      visual evaluation of postures for assessment, intervention monitoring, and 
      feedback during postural re-education.

      palsy].
PG  - 231-6
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the results of surgical treatment for orthopedic 
      problems in adult patients with cerebral palsy. METHODS: Nine adult patients with 
      cerebral palsy (4 females, 5 males; mean age 22 years; range 19 to 29 years) were 
      managed surgically to lessen pain, correct deformities and contractures, and 
      enhance their mobilization potential. Seven patients underwent bilateral 
      multiple-level tendinous and/or musculotendinous release procedures involving the 
      lower extremities, of whom two patients underwent additional triple arthrodesis, 
      and one patient underwent extension osteotomy in the knee. One patient was 
      treated with proximal femoral and distal tibial derotation osteotomies and 
      bilateral hamstring release for knee flexion contractures. Finally, one patient 
      was treated with posterior fusion with instrumentation for thoracolumbar 
      scoliosis. Before surgery, four patients were community ambulators, and one 
      patient could walk only with the aid of bilateral crutches. Four patients with 
      total body involvement could not walk, but they could sit without support except 
      for one patient with scoliosis. The mean follow-up was 25 months (range 8 to 49 
      months). RESULTS: On final evaluations, eight patients could walk without 
      support, and one patient who could not sit preoperatively managed to sit without 
      support. Three patients developed bilateral, five patients developed unilateral 
      superficial skin wounds at the back of the heels associated with cast/brace use, 
      and deep wound infection was encountered in the patient with scoliosis. All the 
      wounds healed with early debridements and antibiotic therapy, together with the 
      modifications made in cast/brace applications, without the need for implant 
      removal. CONCLUSION: Surgical treatment of orthopedic problems in adult patients 
      with cerebral palsy is of substantial importance in enhancing their sitting and 
      walking capacities, and in restoring their community-based relations and 
      activities.

TI  - Test-retest reliability of static EMG scan configural profiling.
PG  - 35-50
AB  - Measurement techniques or instruments are typically evaluated along the 
      dimensions of reliability and validity. The focus of this investigation was to 
      assess the test-retest reliability of a static EMG scan profile (sESP) method 
      using 64 chronic pain participants. The test-retest interval was 30-33 days. 
      Reliability coefficients were expressed using the Profile Similarity Coefficient 
      (rp) in place of the more traditional Pearson Product Moment Correlation. sESP 
      reliabilities were calculated for posture laterality for the head and neck, back, 
      and overall profiles (head, neck, and back combined). The reliability 
      coefficients ranged from .57 to .80. The back profile was the least reliable with 
      a range of .55-.59 whereas the overall profiles were the most reliable, .78-.80. 
      The analysis method was judged to be very conservative with its use of rp, a 
      protracted intertest interval period, and weighting the data by their variances. 
      These results can be viewed as setting the lower reliability limit for sESP.

TI  - Evaluation of an ergonomics intervention among Nicaraguan coffee harvesting 
      workers.
PG  - 166-81
LID - 10.1080/00140139.2012.760753 [doi]
AB  - This study evaluated an ergonomics intervention among Nicaraguan coffee 
      harvesting workers, using electromyography and questionnaire survey techniques. 
      Nicaraguan researchers were involved in the study so that they could gain 
      hands-on experience with ergonomics research and applications, and eventually be 
      the specialists conducting ergonomics interventions in Nicaraguan workplaces. 
      Coffee harvesting activities were studied individually and physical hazards were 
      identified accordingly. The results showed decreased muscle loading on the 
      erector spinae muscle and improved comfort reporting in the back region compared 
      to the commonly used baskets. This fulfils the design objective of a newly 
      developed bag that was used in the intervention to reduce physical workload on 
      the coffee harvesting workers. Workers' opinion survey results showed some issues 
      related to the size of the new bag and the lumbar-shoulder belt mechanism. This 
      information can be used in the modification of the bag in the next design. Key 
      players in the process have been identified. PRACTITIONER SUMMARY: Stimulating 
      ergonomics activities in developing countries is suggested by many experts. This 
      study provided an example from coffee workers in Nicaragua. Commonly used job 
      evaluation procedures and physical load quantification methods were used. 
      Ergonomics researchers and practitioners in developing countries may do similar 
      projects on their own in the future.

TI  - Treatment of symptomatic lumbar disc herniation using activator methods 
      chiropractic technique.
PG  - 187-96
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe a case of symptomatic lumbar disc herniation, successfully 
      treated via chiropractic intervention using Activator Methods Chiropractic 
      Technique. CLINICAL FEATURES: A 26-yr-old man suffered from a chronic 
      multisymptom complex composed of low back pain, left groin pain, left leg pain, 
      left foot drop and associated muscle weakness with atrophy. The symptoms had 
      persisted for more than 2 yr after an athletic injury. Magnetic resonance imaging 
      evaluation revealed a 6-mm focal central disc protrusion with accompanying 
      deformation of the thecal sac, consistent with the presenting symptoms. Lumbar 
      spinal surgery had been recommended to the patient as the appropriate medical 
      management for optimal outcome. INTERVENTION AND OUTCOME: The patient elected to 
      pursue chiropractic treatment in an effort to resolve his condition via 
      conservative management. Chiropractic intervention consisted of mechanical-force, 
      manually assisted short-lever adjusting procedures, rendered via an Activator 
      Adjusting Instrument (AAI). The patient responded favorably and his multisymptom 
      complex resolved within 90 days of treatment. No residuals or recurrences were 
      noted at examination over 1 yr later. CONCLUSION: This report suggests that 
      chiropractic treatment of lumbar disc disorders may be effectively implemented, 
      in certain cases, via mechanical-force, manually assisted adjusting procedures 
      using an AAI. We speculate that the use of an AAI, combined with Activator 
      methods, may provide definitive benefits over side-posture manipulation of the 
      lumbar spine in treatment of resistive disc lesions, because of the lack of 
      torsional stress imposed upon the disc during instrumental spinal adjustment. 
      Further study should be made in this regard to determine the safest and most 
      effective method to treat lumbar disc lesions in a chiropractic setting.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between behavioral risk factors, 
      specifically postural habits, with the presence of structural changes in the 
      spinal column of children and adolescents. METHODS: 59 students were evaluated 
      through the self-reporting Back Pain and Body Posture Evaluation Instrument and 
      spinal panoramic radiographic examination. Spine curvatures were classified based 
      on Cobb angles, as normal or altered in the saggital plane and as normal or 
      scoliotic in the frontal plane. Data were analyzed using SPSS 18.0, based on 
      descriptive statistics and chi-square association test (a=0,05). RESULTS: The 
      prevalence of postural changes was 79.7% (n=47), of which 47.5% (n=28) showed 
      frontal plane changes and 61% (n=36) sagital plane changes. Significant 
      association was found between the presence of thoracic kyphosis and female 
      gender, practice of physical exercises only once or twice a week, sleep time 
      greater than 10 hours, inadequate postures when sitting on a seat and sitting 
      down to write, and how school supplies are carried. Lumbar lordosis was 
      associated with the inadequate way of carrying the school backpack (asymmetric); 
      and scoliosis was associated wuth the practice of competitive sports and sleep 
      time greater than 10 hours. CONCLUSIONS: Lifestyle may be associated with 
      postural changes. It is important to develop health policies in order to reduce 
      the prevalence of postural changes, by decreasing the associated risk factors.

AB  - Conventional and improved methods of aonla pricking were evaluated ergonomically 
      on an experiment conducted for 20 minute with women workers. The working heart 
      rate, energy expenditure rate, total cardiac cost of work and physiological cost 
      of work with conventional tools varied from 93-102 beats.min-1, 6-7.5 kJ.min-1, 
      285-470 beats, 14 -23 beats.min-1 while with machine varied from 96-105 
      beats.min-1, 6.5-8 kJ.min-1 , 336-540 beats, 16-27 beats.min-1 respectively. OWAS 
      score for conventional method was 2 indicating corrective measures in near future 
      while with machine was 1 indicating no corrective measures. Result of Nordic 
      Musculoskeletal Questionnaire revealed that subjects complaint of pain in back, 
      neck, right shoulder and right hand due to unnatural body posture and repetitive 
      movement with hand tool. Moreover pricking was carried out in improper lighting 
      conditions (200-300 lux) resulting into finger injuries from sharp edges of hand 
      tool, whereas with machine no such problems were observed. Output with machine 
      increased thrice than hand pricking in a given time. Machine was found useful in 
      terms of saving time, increased productivity, enhanced safety and comfort as 
      involved improved posture, was easy to handle and operate, thus increasing 
      efficiency of the worker leading to better quality of life.

TI  - 3D back shape in healthy young adults: an inter-rater and intra-rater reliability 
      study.
PG  - 505-8
AB  - Whilst postural evaluation of spinal dysfunction is routine in physiotherapy 
      practice, objective measurements are rarely undertaken due to the scarcity of 
      reliable low cost assessment tools. Warren et al [12] found high intrarater 
      reliability but inter-rater reliability has not as yet been evaluated. The 
      purpose of this study was to assess both the intra-rater and inter-rater 
      reliability of the Middlesbrough Integrated Digital Assessment system (MIDAS). 
      METHODS: A convenience sample of twenty-five healthy University of Teesside 
      students was recruited for the study. One rater palpated fifteen key landmarks on 
      each subjects back. Each of three raters took two measurements on each subject in 
      a standardized upright posture. Rater order was randomized to minimize data 
      recording bias. X (medio-lateral), Y (antero-posterior) and Z (height) landmark 
      positions were recorded via a computer interface. DATA ANALYSIS: Intraclass 
      Correlation Coefficients (ICC 2,1) were used to analyse data using SPSS v13. 
      RESULTS: Both intra-rater agreement (mean ICCs - rater 1 r= 0.970, rater 2 r= 
      0.965 and rater 3 r= 0.965, p<0.001) and inter-rater agreement (mean ICCs r = 
      0.967, p<0.001 was very high between repeated measures and between markers. Error 
      values for the z-axis (height) were lowest. CONCLUSIONS: The system demonstrated 
      both high inter-rater and intra-rater reliability. Before the system is used on a 
      clinical population, data output needs to be converted from raw format to a 
      clinically applicable format. Work is currently being undertaken to develop an 
      interactive visual display and control for postural sway.

TI  - Functional MRI of the lumbar spine in erect position in a superconducting 
      open-configuration MR system: preliminary results.
PG  - 1329-33
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the feasibility of obtaining, and 
      findings in, functional MRI of the lumbar spine in an erect position and with 
      flexion and extension. Thirty subjects (including 5 volunteers) were imaged in a 
      sitting position and while performing flexion and extension. The alternations in 
      posterior disk margin, size of neural foramina, and central canal were evaluated. 
      In addition, routine supine imaging was accomplished in 15 of these subjects. The 
      foraminal size and posterior disk margins did not change appreciably from supine 
      to upright position. With extension, there was an increased disk bulge in 27% of 
      disks (40% of those with desiccation). Central canal size (50%) and foraminal 
      size (27%) decreased with extension, especially at levels with disk desiccation. 
      Images obtained with our open-configuration MR unit were diagnostically adequate, 
      although of inferior quality compared with those obtained with a conventional 
      unit. Our preliminary results show the feasibility of obtaining diagnostic images 
      of the erect lumbar spine with flexion and extension. The results are in 
      agreement with those obtained with cadaveric studies. The utility of this method 
      in diagnostic imaging of patients with low back pain remains to be determined.

TI  - Electromyographic activity of the lumbar extensor muscles: effect of angle and 
      hand position during Roman chair exercise.
PG  - 751-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of angle and hand position during 
      variable-angle Roman chair (VARC) back extension exercise on lumbar paraspinal 
      electromyographic (EMG) activity. DESIGN: Descriptive, repeated measures. 
      SETTING: University-based musculoskeletal research laboratory. PARTICIPANTS: Two 
      female and eight male volunteers recruited from a university setting. 
      INTERVENTION AND OUTCOME MEASURES: Surface integrated EMG activity was recorded 
      from the L3-L4 paraspinal region during 24 10-second repetitions of dynamic back 
      extension exercise, each consisting of a unique VARC angle (six total) and 
      subject hand position (four total). Lumbar paraspinal surface integrated EMG 
      activity measured in millivolts per repetition was used for analysis. RESULTS: 
      Significant lumbar paraspinal EMG activity was evident during each of the 24 
      repetitions (p < or = .05), with a 104% increase in activity noted between the 
      lowest and highest. EMG activity increased progressively among hand positions and 
      as the VARC angle became more horizontal. VARC angle affected EMG activity more 
      than hand position, but the greatest impact on EMG activity was produced by 
      modifying both angle and hand position. CONCLUSION: Lumbar paraspinal EMG 
      activity can be altered during VARC back extension exercise by changing angle and 
      hand position. Clinicians can use these data to develop progressive resistance 
      exercise programs using the VARC apparatus.

TI  - Development and initial assessment of objective fatigue measures for apple 
      harvest work.
PG  - 719-27
AB  - Previous research has shown that neck, back and shoulder musculoskeletal strain 
      is a major occupational health problem affecting migrant orchard harvest workers. 
      Researchers seek to measure the effect of an ergonomic modification to the apple 
      picking bucket on muscle fatigue, however objective measures for use in the 
      orchard are not yet available. The purpose of this study is to develop simple 
      back, shoulder or arm strength measures, which detect statistically significant 
      drops in strength over one workday. Candidate muscle strength measures were 
      piloted in the laboratory, adapted for the orchard and evaluated (n=102). Data 
      were analyzed for morning to afternoon fatigue, and for correlation between 
      fatigue score and hours worked. In the laboratory, the timed arm hold (35.7% time 
      reduction, 95% CI: 21.81-49.61), and the timed spinal extension (31.8% time 
      reduction, 95% CI: 23.54-39.96) showed significant fatigue. In the orchard 
      (n=102), only the timed arm hold showed significant (11.4%, p<.0001) fatigue. The 
      potential effect of field conditions and subject motivation on these results 
      needs further exploration.

TI  - Spinal needle design and size affect the incidence of postdural puncture headache 
      in children.
PG  - 177-82
LID - 10.1111/j.1460-9592.2009.03236.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In adults, pencil point spinal needles are known to be less traumatic 
      and hence to be superior compared with cutting point needles in respect of 
      postpuncture complications. In children, only a few trials have evaluated the 
      difference in the incidence of postdural puncture headache (PDPH) using spinal 
      needles with different tip designs. The aim of this study was to evaluate the 
      success rate and the incidence of PDPH and backache following spinal anesthesia 
      (SA) with the two types of needles currently in use for children. METHODS: This 
      is a retrospective study of prospectively collected data. The success rate and 
      postpuncture complications of 26G cutting point (Atraucan) spinal needle were 
      compared with 27G pencil point (Pencan) spinal needle in 414 children aged 2-17 
      years undergoing surgery with SA. RESULTS: Both needles had similar first-attempt 
      success rates: 87% in the cutting point group and 91% in the pencil point group 
      (P = 0.16). Pencil point needles caused less PDPH compared to cutting point 
      needles; 0.4% vs 4.5%, respectively (P = 0.005). Both needles caused similar 
      backache (P = 0.08). No severe neurologic symptom was reported for both needles. 
      CONCLUSION: The data suggest that 27G pencil point spinal needles lead to less 
      PDPH compared to 26G cutting point spinal needles in children.

TI  - Application of Machine Learning Approaches for Classifying Sitting Posture Based 
      on Force and Acceleration Sensors.
PG  - 5978489
LID - 5978489
AB  - Occupational musculoskeletal disorders, particularly chronic low back pain (LBP), 
      are ubiquitous due to prolonged static sitting or nonergonomic sitting positions. 
      Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop an instrumented chair with force 
      and acceleration sensors to determine the accuracy of automatically identifying 
      the user's sitting position by applying five different machine learning methods 
      (Support Vector Machines, Multinomial Regression, Boosting, Neural Networks, and 
      Random Forest). Forty-one subjects were requested to sit four times in seven 
      different prescribed sitting positions (total 1148 samples). Sixteen force sensor 
      values and the backrest angle were used as the explanatory variables (features) 
      for the classification. The different classification methods were compared by 
      means of a Leave-One-Out cross-validation approach. The best performance was 
      achieved using the Random Forest classification algorithm, producing a mean 
      classification accuracy of 90.9% for subjects with which the algorithm was not 
      familiar. The classification accuracy varied between 81% and 98% for the seven 
      different sitting positions. The present study showed the possibility of 
      accurately classifying different sitting positions by means of the introduced 
      instrumented office chair combined with machine learning analyses. The use of 
      such novel approaches for the accurate assessment of chair usage could offer 
      insights into the relationships between sitting position, sitting behaviour, and 
      the occurrence of musculoskeletal disorders.

TI  - [Kyphotic deformities of the cervical spin].
PG  - 215-24
AB  - PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: The development of a cervical kyphotic deformity can be 
      associated with a degenerative disease, trauma, tumour, developmental anomaly and 
      also a surgical procedure. Post-operative kyphosis can develop after both the 
      anterior and posterior surgical approaches. The deformity can also result from 
      systemic diseases, such as ankylosing spondylitis or rheumatoid arthritis. The 
      aim of the study was to make the clinical and radiographic evaluation of a group 
      of patients with kyphotic deformity treated at our department. MATERIAL: Between 
      May 2005 and April 2010, a total of 102 patients underwent correction of cervical 
      kyphosis at our department. (Center for Spinal Surgery). Of them, 90 patients 
      with complete medical records and post-operative periods longer than 6 months 
      were included in this study. There were 36 men and 54 women ranging in age from 
      13 to 90 years and with an average of 56.7 years. In six patients cervical 
      kyphosis was caused by an inveterate injury, in 71 by degenerative disease, in 
      six it developed in association with rheumatoid arthritis, and in seven patients 
      it was due to previous surgery. Patients with acute trauma, tumour, infectious 
      disease or congenital anomaly were not included. METHODS: All patients were 
      examined before surgery by radiography in antero-posterior and lateral 
      projection, including flexion- extension bending films, and by CT scanning of 
      ultrathin cross-sections with sagittal, frontal and recently also 3D 
      reconstructions. Magnetic resonance imaging in three planes was also performed. 
      On the basis of the results and clinical examination, the operative strategy was 
      planned. Surgery was carried out from the anterior or the posterior approach, or 
      the combined approach was used. Three-stage surgery was performed in one patient. 
      The surgical outcome was assessed using the Nurick score and Neck Disability 
      Index (NDI), the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) was used to evaluate pain intensity 
      or paraesthesia. Statistical analysis was done using the Chi-square test and 
      paired t-test. RESULTS: The average NDI value was 25.5 before surgery and 14.3 
      and 14.9 at one and two years after surgery, respectively. Compared with the 
      pre-operative state, improvement or no changes were recorded in 89.7 % of the 
      patients; transient deterioration occurred in 10.3 %. Improvements found were as 
      follows: by one degree in 46.2 % of the patients, by two degrees in 18 %, by 
      three degrees in 5.1 % and by five degrees in 2.6 % of the patients. The 
      condition remained unchanged in 18 % of the patients. The average outcome was an 
      improvement by one degree. The average pre-operative Nurick score was 0.7; an 
      average post-operative value of 0.6 was recorded at both one and two years of 
      follow-up. The average VAS value for neck and radicular pain was 5.7 
      pre-operatively, and 2.5 and 2.7 at one and two post-operative years, 
      respectively. Out of 90 patients, complete bone union was achieved at 6 months 
      after surgery in 88 patients (97.8 %). The average pre-operative value for the 
      cervical curvature index (Ishihara) was -13.7; the average pre-operative cervical 
      kyphosis was -14.4 degrees, ranging from -2.2 to -44.0 degrees. After surgery, 
      the average Ishihara index was +15.3 and the average lordosis was +13.5 degrees, 
      with a range of -16.0 to + 37.4 degrees. DISCUSSION: A single/isolated anterior 
      approach can be used for fixed deformities without ankylosing spondylitis. It 
      allows for decompression of the anterior pathology and for correction of cervical 
      kyphosis with use of instrumentation and structural graft. A combined 
      ventral-dorsal approach is appropriate in fixed deformities or deformities 
      involving the cervico-thoracic junction. The main principle of correction is to 
      lengthen the cervical spinal column in the front and to shorten it at the back by 
      anterior decompression with or without instrumentation and by subsequent 
      posterior stabilisation. An isolated/single dorsal correction can be used in the 
      case of successful correction by traction or specific head positioning on the 
      table without anterior nerve compression. In severe fixed deformities such as 
      Bekhterev's disease, the chin can be so close to the chest as to interfere with 
      eating and breathing. The deformity most often develops at the cervico-thoracic 
      junction and requires treatment by osteotomy. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the 
      study showed a marked improvement in the patients' quality of life after kyphosis 
      correction, improved neurological status and an improved posture seen on 
      radiograms of the cervical spine. The study also revealed a higher number of 
      potential complications associated, in particular, with corrective osteotomy. The 
      best results were achieved with the combined surgical approach; however, the 
      choice of a surgical method was independent of the patient's clinical status.

TI  - Randomized radiostereometric study comparing osteogenic protein-1 (BMP-7) and 
      autograft bone in human noninstrumented posterolateral lumbar fusion: 2002 Volvo 
      Award in clinical studies.
PG  - 2654-61
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Randomized efficacy trial comparing two types of noninstrumented 
      posterolateral fusion between L5 and S1 in patients with L5 spondylolysis and 
      vertebral slip less than 50%, as evaluated by radiostereometric analysis. 
      OBJECTIVE: To determine whether osteogenic protein-1 (BMP-7) in the OP-1 Implant 
      yields better stabilizing bony fusion than autograft bone. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND 
      DATA: Animal studies of osteoinductive proteins in noninstrumented posterolateral 
      fusions have shown high fusion rates. No similar conclusive study on humans has 
      been performed. METHODS: For this study, 20 patients were randomized to fusion 
      with either OP-1 Implant or autograft bone from the iliac crest, 10 in each 
      group. The patients were instructed to keep the trunk straight for 5 months after 
      surgery with the aid of a soft lumbar brace. At surgery 0.8-mm metallic markers 
      were positioned in L5 and the sacrum, enabling radiostereometric follow-up 
      analysis during 1 year. The three-dimensional vertebral movements, as measured by 
      radiostereometric analysis induced by positional change from supine posture to 
      standing and sitting, were calculated with an accuracy of 0.5 to 0.7 mm and 0.5 
      degrees to 2.0 degrees. Conventional radiography was added. RESULTS: No 
      significant difference was noted between the radiostereometric and radiographic 
      results of fusion with the OP-1 Implant and fusion with autograft bone. There was 
      a significant relation between reduced vertebral movements and better bone 
      formation. No adverse effects of the OP-1 Implant occurred. Persistent minor pain 
      at the iliac crest was noticed in one patient. CONCLUSIONS: There was no 
      significant difference between the two fusion versions. Thus, the OP-1 Implant 
      did not yield better stabilizing bony fusion than autograft bone.

TI  - The effect of weight-bearing exercise with low frequency, whole body vibration on 
      lumbosacral proprioception: a pilot study on normal subjects.
PG  - 259-63
AB  - Patients with low back pain (LBP) often present with impaired proprioception of 
      the lumbopelvic region. For this reason, proprioception training usually forms 
      part of the rehabilitation protocols. New exercise equipment that produces whole 
      body, low frequency vibration (WBV) has been developed to improve muscle 
      function, and reportedly improves proprioception. The aim of this pilot study was 
      to investigate whether weightbearing exercise given in conjunction with WBV would 
      affect lumbosacral position sense in healthy individuals. For this purpose, 
      twenty-five young individuals with no LBP were assigned randomly to an 
      experimental or control group. The experimental group received WBV for five 
      minutes while holding a static, semi-squat position. The control group adopted 
      the same weightbearing position for equal time but received no vibration. A 
      two-dimensional motion analysis system measured the repositioning accuracy of 
      pelvic tilting in standing. The experimental (WBV) group demonstrated a 
      significant improvement in repositioning accuracy over time (mean 0.78 degrees) 
      representing 39% improvement. It was concluded that WBV may induce improvements 
      in lumbosacral repositioning accuracy when combined with a weightbearing 
      exercise. Future studies with WBV should focus on evaluating its effects with 
      different types of exercise, the exercise time needed for optimal outcomes, and 
      the effects on proprioception deficits in LBP patients.

TI  - Development of a system for analyzing working postures.
PG  - 69-77
AB  - In order to assist in the analysis of working postures which might cause lumbago 
      in the field of industrial health, a system was developed for the synchronous 
      recording and analyzing of postures, work content and physiological data. The 
      system is composed of a portable unit for recording 3 channels of goniometers, 1 
      channel of inclinometer and 1 channel of surface electromyogram, a video camera 
      for recording work content, a host computer and some peripheral devices for 
      analyzing the data from the portable unit and video camera. In this system, 
      postures are automatically classified from data on joint angles and upper body 
      inclination angle by using a discriminant function. The joint angles are measured 
      by the goniometers using rubber optical fibers. The angle of upper body 
      inclination is obtained by the inclinometer using a magnetic resistance sensor. 
      In addition to the work content and video images, the postures and the 
      electromyogram can be analyzed and confirmed by simultaneous display of the data 
      on the host computer screen. Based on the trial use of this system in a work 
      model of manual baggage handling, it was proved useful for evaluating in detail 
      the workload caused by working postures.

TI  - Combined single stage anterior and posterior osteotomy for correction of 
      iatrogenic lumbar kyphosis.
PG  - 257-66
AB  - Fifty-four patients were treated by a standardized single stage anterior opening 
      wedge and a posterior closing extension wedge osteotomy for back pain associated 
      with postoperative loss of lumbar lordosis (iatrogenic flat back syndrome). 
      Presenting complaints were fatigue, pain and a stooped posture. Etiological 
      factors were, in descending order of frequency, distraction instrumentation with 
      the lower end at the L5 or S1 vertebra, thoracolumbar junction kyphosis greater 
      than 15 degrees, especially if associated with a hypokyphotic thoracic spine, and 
      degenerative changes above and below a previous fusion. Kostuik-Harrington 
      instrumentation was used anteriorly for the opening wedge and Dwyer cables and 
      screws together with a midline plate were used posteriorly for the closing 
      extension osteotomy. Malunion occurred in three patients, one requiring 
      recorrection. Pain relief occurred in 48 (90%). Neurological complications 
      occurred in two patients, one with permanent deficient. Follow-up averaged 4 
      years. Average preosteotomy lordosis L1-S1 was 21.5 degrees and was restored to 
      49 degrees (equal to the lordosis before the initial surgery) for an average 
      correction of 29 degrees, (range 24 degrees to 63 degrees). Prevention of this 
      complication can be accomplished by maintaining normal lordosis at the time of 
      initial surgery.

TI  - Testing of a biomechanical model of the lumbar muscle force distribution using 
      quasi-static loading exercises.
PG  - 442-9
AB  - The study of lumbar muscle force distribution in response to externally applied 
      loads is based on the introduction of biomechanical models of the lumbar region. 
      The evaluation of such models requires the execution of loading exercises while 
      monitoring the EMG activity of certain lumbar muscles. This work uses muscle 
      activity maps as the major design tool of such exercises, provided that the 
      subject is constrained to an upright erect posture. The maps describe the 
      predicted muscle force for a given combination of externally applied bending 
      moments. A series of shoulder adduction exercises were designed and the EMG 
      signals of eight lumbar muscles were measured while subjects performed the 
      exercises. The results show good agreement between the model predictions and the 
      EMG measurements, especially when the load and the muscle were contralateral to 
      one another.

      in the posterior lumbar soft tissue. The lead could not be removed even with 
      moderate force or with spine in the flexed position. Radiologic evaluation 
      revealed that edge of metallic lead was wedged into the soft tissue. We were able 
      to remove the lead only after placing the patient in an extreme tuck position 
      (knee-to-chest); thus possibly avoiding surgical intervention.
