AB  - Background: Back pain is an important public health problem and the leading cause of adult disability worldwide and is rising among schoolchildren populations. Despite numerous studies reporting on back care interventions in pediatric population; there is currently no existing theory-based instrument to assess impact and outcome of these programs. This paper reports on development and psychometric testing of a theory based back-care behavior instrument for use among elementary schoolchildren. Methods: This was a three-phases study that included the following steps: a) a literature research to review existing instruments that assess healthy spine-related behavior in elementary schoolchildren; b) development of a new instrument namely the Back-care Behavior Assessment Questionnaire (BABAQ) based on the Social Cognitive Theory and existing instruments, and c) conducting a cross sectional study to test psychometric properties of the BABAQ by estimating the content validity ratio (CVR), the content validity index (CVI), performing confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), reliability analysis, and convergent validity as estimated by the Average Variance Extracted (AVE). Results: First, a questionnaire (the BABAQ) was developed. It contained of 49 items tapping into 5 pre-defined constructs (skills, knowledge, self-efficacy, expectation beliefs, and behavior). Then, 610 fifth-grade female schoolchildren were entered into a cross sectional study and they completed the BABAQ. The CVR and the CVI of the questionnaire was found to be ≥0.54 and > 0.7, respectively. The CFA confirmed the five constructs and showed good fit for the data. The intraclass correlation (ICC) and the Cronbach's alpha coefficients for the BABAQ were 0.84 (P < 0.001) and 0.93, respectively. The convergent validity as measured by the AVE also showed satisfactory results. Conclusion: The findings suggest that the Back-care Behavior Assessment Questionnaire (BABAQ) is a valid instrument for measuring healthy spine-related behaviors among schoolchildren.  © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - Background Case detection delay (CDD) is associated with grade 2 disability (G2D) in leprosy, a substantial disease burden worldwide. The standardized CDD questionnaire was developed to determine the period of CDD and its related factors. In Indonesia, the incidence of leprosy and G2D is high and an instrument to measure CDD is lacking. This study describes the translation and cross-cultural adaptation process and evaluates the CDD questionnaire in the Indonesian context. Methods We first did forward–backward translation into Bahasa Indonesia and cross-culturally adapted the CDD questionnaire. We then performed face-to-face three-step test interviews in a pilot test to evaluate the understanding of leprosy patients and the content validity of the CDD questionnaire (n = 15). Finally, the reliability and construct validity of the CDD questionnaire were tested in 50 leprosy patients in Tegal Regency, Indonesia. Results The interviews showed that leprosy patients understood the CDD questionnaire well. The content and construct validity were adequate according to linguistic validation and statistical hypothesis testing. The internal consistency test with a Cronbach alpha showed that the CDD questionnaire measures one underlying con-struct. The reproducibility test, including the test–retest reliability and agreement test, indicated excellent reliability. Conclusions The version of the CDD questionnaire in Bahasa Indonesia is an instrument with good validity and reliability to determine CDD in Indonesia. We recommend its implementation in the leprosy control programme of Indonesia for monitoring early case detection and thereby avoiding leprosy disability. © The author(s).

AB  - Background: The BackPEI questionnaire was developed and validated just exclusively to evaluate children. Aims: To propose, validate, and test the reproducibility of an expanded version of the Back Pain and Body Posture Evaluation Instrument (BackPEI), originally designed to assess back pain in school-aged children, for use with adults. Design: Validation Study. Methods: Five questions from the original BackPEI were replaced, resulting in the revised instrument (BackPEI-A) containing 20 questions. Three experts checked the content validity of the revised instrument, and the reproducibility was tested by trialing the questionnaire with 154 adults. Results: The reproducibility data for the questions regarding pain intensity, analyzed using the Wilcoxon test and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), indicated that (a) there was no difference between the medians and (b) the answers were highly correlated, both for lower back (p =.574) (ICC = 0.908) and cervical (p =.968) (ICC = 0.865) pain. The reproducibility data for the remaining questions analyzed using the κ coefficient were classified as moderate (0.4 < κ ≤ 0.6) or very good (κ > 0.8). Conclusion: The BackPEI-A is a reproducible, valid, and reliable instrument for use in the evaluation of back and neck pain and their associated risk factors. The instrument also facilitates the evaluation of postural habits in activities of daily living in adults. © 2017 American Society for Pain Management Nursing

AB  - Background. The study aimed to develop a reliable and valid Teachers’ Body Posture Literacy Questionnaire (TBPLQ) to examine their body posture knowledge. Methods. The tool was based on a Parents Body Posture Literacy Questionnaire (PBPLQ) and modified and validated through discussion with experts, conducted in two rounds. Corrective gymnastics, physiotherapy, ergonomics, and physical education (PE) experts and doctoral and postdoctoral scholars evaluated content validity. Test-retest repeatability was tested using Cohen’s kappa coefficient. The study used a convenience sample of 195 teachers from three different educational levels: PE, kindergarten, and primary education in two rounds of test-retest (pilot test-retest reliability and main test-retest reliability of the questionnaire). The first round encompassed 95 participants, with pre-test and post-test procedures applied using the original TBPLQ. The second round involved 100 participants and followed a similar approach, incorporating modifications to the TBPLQ based on the reliability outcomes observed in the first round. Results. The results of the first-round test-retest TBPLQ reliability, with 95 samples, resulted in an overall reliability of 0.77 (range 0.02 to 1). This indicated that the questionnaire still lacks sufficient reliability. Consequently, after the necessary amendments and modifications, the questionnaire’s reliability was tested for the second time with 100 samples. Notably, the overall reliability of 0.82 (ranging from 0.50 to 1) was established for the TBPLQ indicating that 87.5% of the questionnaire items achieved reliability scores within the substantial and almost perfect range and only 12.5% of the items attained moderate reliability scores. Conclusions. The questionnaire is a new self-report measure for evaluating teachers’ literacy in postural health. It is applicable in both research and practical contexts, extending its use to larger and more diverse populations. Copyright 2024 Labecka et al.

AB  - Owing to the lack of longitudinal studies in Latin American countries, we aimed to evaluate back pain and its risk factors in a 3-year longitudinal study of Brazilian adolescents. We analysed data of 525 adolescents (aged 11–16 years) attending primary school (fifth to eighth grade) in Brazil. The students were administered the self-reported Back Pain and Body Posture Evaluation Instrument (BackPEI) questionnaire in 2011 and at a follow-up evaluation that was conducted 3 years later (2014). Back pain was the outcome variable; the exposure variables included exercise, behavioural, hereditary and postural factors. Generalized estimating equations were used to perform a Poisson regression model with robust variance to evaluate the risk factors for back pain. The prevalence of back pain at baseline was 56% (n = 294); this increased significantly at the 3-year follow-up evaluation to 65.9% (n = 346). The frequency of experiencing back pain also significantly increased after 3 years in both boys (p = 0.002) and girls (p = 0.001). The prevalence of back pain increased significantly in adolescents up to the age of 13 years, stabilized in those aged 14 years and older and was higher among girls. A family history of back pain (in the parents), watching television for lengthy periods and carrying a backpack asymmetrically were predictors for back pain. © The British Pain Society 2019.

AB  - Most studies on the prevalence of back pain have evaluated it in developed countries (Human Development Index-HDI > 0.808), and their conclusions may not hold for developing countries. The aim of this study was to identify the prevalence of back pain in representative Brazilian athletes from public high schools. This cross-sectional study was performed during the state phase of the 2015 Jogos dos Institutos Federais (JIF), or Federal Institutes Games, in Brazil (HDI = 0.744), and it enrolled 251 athletes, 173 males and 78 females (14-20 years old). The dependent variable was back pain, and the independent variables were demographic, socioeconomic, psychosocial, hereditary, exercise-level, anthropometric, strength, behavioral, and postural factors. The prevalence ratio (PR) was calculated using multivariable analysis according to the Poisson regression model (α = 0.05). The prevalence of back pain in the three months prior to the study was 43.7% (n = 104), and 26% of the athletes reported feeling back pain only once. Multivariable analysis showed that back pain was associated with demographic (sex), psychosocial (loneliness and loss of sleep in the previous year), hereditary (ethnicity, parental back pain), strength (lumbar and hand forces), anthropometric (body mass index), behavioral (sleeping time per night, reading and studying in bed, smoking habits in the previous month), and postural (sitting posture while writing, while on a bench, and while using a computer) variables. Participants who recorded higher levels of lumbar and manual forces reported a lower prevalence of back pain (PR < 0.79), whereas feeling lonely in the previous year, obesity, and ethnicity exhibited the highest prevalence ratio (PR > 1.30). In conclusion, there is no association between exercise levels and back pain but there is an association between back pain and non-exercise related variables. © 2016 Noll et al.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.

AB  - Introduction Indicators of administrative professionals' quality of life (QoL) in educational institutions are essential for planning improvements in their daily lives. QoL is a recurring topic in academic research, particularly in the healthcare sector. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the perceptions of administrative professionals in educational institutions regarding their QoL and the implications of remote and in-person work. Additionally, we aim to compare the QoL before, during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods and analysis Five electronic databases will be searched for this systematic review: CINAHL, LILACS, PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science. Original, peer-reviewed articles published in any language, without time limitations, will be included in this study. Two researchers will screen the articles and extract the data. The included articles will be evaluated for the quality of their evidence using Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations. The risk of bias will be assessed using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme checklist and the Downs and Black scale. A third reviewer will resolve any discrepancies. Ethics and dissemination The systematic review results will be published in a peer-reviewed journal and presented at a relevant conference. The data will not include individual patient data; therefore, ethical approval is not required. PROSPERO registration number CRD42022365862.  © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023.

AB  - Aim: To examine the effect of a once-a-week group physiotherapy session in addition to a once-a-month individual physiotherapy treatment, in comparison to a monthly individual physiotherapy treatment. Methods: Fifty children and adolescents aged 10-18 years with poor back posture, some of whom had LBP, met individually with a physiotherapist once a month. The intervention group received an additional once-a-week group physiotherapy session for 12 weeks. Thorax curve angle, postural behavior, and low back pain (LBP) were measured before and after intervention. Results: The thorax curve angle decreased from 39.2 ± 9.3 to 28.2 ± 6.8 (p < 0.001) in the group + individual therapy group and from 38.9 ± 9.3 to 27.9 ± 7.8 in the individual therapy only group (p < 0.001). LBP decreased from 5.6 ± 2.2 to 1.6 ± 1.9 (p < 0.001) and from 5.5 ± 2.1 to 2.8 ± 2.0 (p < 0.001). A significantly greater improvement in postural behavior was found in the group + individual therapy group (p = 0.04). Moreover, attrition rates were lower in the experimental group. Conclusion: A lower-frequency individual physiotherapy treatment for 12 weeks proved as beneficial as the same program with an additional higher-frequency group physiotherapy in improving thorax curve angle and LBP. However, the higher-frequency group physiotherapy in addition to the lower-frequency individual treatment was significantly more effective in improving postural behavior and adherence to treatment. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Objective: The purpose of this study was to estimate the prevalence of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS), and back pain and its risk factors, in schoolchildren from the semiarid region of Brazil. Methods: A total of 520 adolescents aged 10 to 16 years old were assessed. The students were administered the self-reported Back Pain and Body Posture Evaluation Instrument questionnaire. The screening for AIS included measuring the angle of trunk rotation using a scoliometer in the Adams forward-bend test. Participants with an angle of trunk rotation ≥ 7° were referred for radiography. The prevalence ratio was estimated by multivariable analysis using a Poisson regression model (α = 0.05). Results: Among the participants, 3.1% (95% confidence interval, 3.2%-6.9%) had a confirmed AIS diagnosis: 1.9% girls and 1.1% boys. There was no difference between boys and girls in AIS prevalence. The prevalence of back pain in the previous 3 months was 63.7% (95% confidence interval, 59.5%-67.7%), at a moderate level (visual analog scale = 3.83; 95% confidence interval, 3.57-4.08). Multivariable analysis showed that back pain is associated with postural variables, sex, and age. Conclusion: The prevalence of AIS in the semiarid region of Brazil was 3.1%, and that of back pain was 63.7%. Only body mass index was different between adolescents with and without AIS, with those with AIS having a lower mean body mass index. Back pain was higher in girls and increased in older adolescents. Furthermore, behavioral and postural habits and hereditary factors were associated with an increased chance of back pain. © 2022

AB  - Objective: Identify the postural changes in the sagittal plane and its associated factors in adolescents from public state schools of the city of Capão da Canoa - RS. Methods: Was performed a cross-sectional study that evaluated 185 adolescents (14 to 19 years old) regarding backpack weight, thoracic and lumbar curvature angles. Self-reporting questionnaires were used to assess postural habits, lifestyle, health and well-being, and socioeconomic status, being the postural alterations evaluated by the Flexi curve method. The data were analyzed through Chi-square test, Fisher Exact test and Poisson Regression (p<0.05). Results: There was a high prevalence of back pain in 125 adolescents (67.60%) and postural alteration in 75 (40.5%), with 5 (2.7%) presenting thoracic deviation and 70 (37.9%), lumbar deviation, in which 5.6% of the sample presented more than one postural alteration. There was an association between male gender with thoracic kyphosis (p=0.014) and lumbar rectification. Conclusion: The present study evidenced a high prevalence of back pain and inappropriate postural habits that can be pointed out as the associated factors responsible for the evidenced postural alterations. © 2019, Nucleo de Estudos da Saude do Adolescente.

AB  - Objectives: to investigate the prevalence of back pain during a prior three-month period; to identify postural and behavioral habits; to assess whether a relationship exists between back pain and the postural and behavioral habits of elementary school students in the municipal school network in the city of Teutônia, Rio Grande do Sul (RS). Methods: this was an epidemiological population study in which 833 5th to 8th grade students from schools in the municipal school network in Teutônia participated. The students completed a Back Pain and Body Posture Evaluation Instrument (BackPEI) questionnaire that assessed back pain and postural and behavioral habits. The analysis was performed using descriptive statistics, calculating prevalence ratios (PR) and confidence intervals at the 95% level. The dependent variable was back pain, and the independent variables were postural and behavioral habits. The PR was calculated using a multivariate analysis with robust variance (α = 0.05). Results: the prevalence of back pain in the previous three months was 54.1%. The majority of students reported feeling pain once per month, and 17.4% of the students reported that pain impaired their performance of daily activities. The multivariate analysis showed a correlation between back pain and time spent per day watching television (p = 0.046), sleeping posture (p = 0.048) and sitting down to write (p = 0.032). Conclusions: these results demonstrate a high prevalence of back pain in schoolchildren, suggesting an urgent need to develop educational and preventative programs in schools.

AB  - Introduction: Physical exercise improves physical fitness and health, helping to reduce pain and prevent low back pain. This study aims to compare the intensity of low back pain (LBP), behavioral habits, and the level of disability and kinesiophobia among exercising and non-exercising subjects with LBP. Methods: Consecutive sample of 102 individuals was divided into exercising group (EG) and non-exercising group (NEG). The data was extracted from the answers to the questionnaires Back Pain and Body Posture Evaluation Instrument (BackPEI-A), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and Fear-avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire (FABQ-Brazil). For statistical analysis, the chi-square test was used, α ≤ 0.05. Results: Both groups presented predominance of mild to moderate pain intensity and absence of kinesiophobia in the practice of physical activity, with no statistically significant difference. However, there was significant difference between the groups for the risk of occurrence of LBP and for levels of incapacity and kinesiophobia related to work. Conclusion: Exercising individuals appear to present with a lower risk for occurrence of LBP, lower level of disability, and absence of work-related kinesiophobia. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Knowledge is a determining factor for the development of postural habits; it could be considered as the first step in the establishment of changes. The aim of this study was to analyze the level of specific back-health-related physical activity and exercise knowledge in adolescents. A cross-sectional study was conducted on a sample of 1500 high school students between the ages of 13 and 18 (mean age = 15.18 ± 1.44). Students from the Valencian Community (Spain) were recruited with a confidence level of 95% and an accepted standard error of ± 2.53%. Self-report questionnaires were used to record back-health-related physical activity knowledge. The level of specific knowledge of back-health education related to physical activity and exercise in adolescents was low (X = 2.05 ± 2.26). Only 10.9% of the students passed the specific knowledge test, achieving a score equal or superior to 5. The boys’ average score was higher (X = 2.17 ± 2.31) than the girls’ (X = 1.94 ± 2.21) with statistically significant differences (p = 0.048). The level of specific knowledge increased with age (p < 0.001). Secondary school students show a low level of specific knowledge concerning back health. It is recommended that back care education be a part of school curriculum. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Incorrect postural habits developed already at an early age are predictors of low back pain and functional limitations in adult life. Postural education programs (PEPs) are activities developed in Physical Education classes with the aim of promoting healthy habits. One tool used by PEPs is comics. The objective of this study was to develop comics and apply them as a teaching tool in PEPs for students aged seven to ten years. The procedures were based on individual empowerment principles, including creation activities, reading, painting, crosswords, and discussion of comics. The activities strengthened the students’ interactions, gaining new knowledge that required cognitive and expressive resources to interpret, associate, and conceptualize themes of correct body posture. During six weeks of intervention, knowledge about body posture, anatomy, and health promotion exercises increased significantly in relation to the beginning of activities. The comic book proved to be an effective, attractive, and low-cost didactic resource. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Objective (s): Low back pain is a common disorder of spine. One of the most important concerns is the increasing rate of low back pain in schoolchildren that might predict adult disability. The purpose of this study was to explain the structural relationship between low back pain and spine-related behavior among pupils via structural equation modeling based on social cognitive theory (SCT). The hypothesized model included skills, knowledge of spine care principals, self-efficacy, and expectation beliefs as independent variables, and spine-related behavior as a dependent variable. Methods: We collected data from 204 students attending public elementary schools using a structured questionnaire in Tehran, Iran from October 2018 to March 2019. The hypothesized model was examined via a structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis using SPSS, version 24.0, and LISREL, version 8.80. Results: The effect of skills, knowledge, self-efficacy and beliefs on spine-related behavior was 0.73 (t-value=13.09), 0.42 (tvalue= 6.71), 0.87 (t-value=16.67), and 0.55 (t-value=4.95) respectively. In addition, various indicators, such as Comparative Fit Index (CFI), Normed Fit Index (NFI), ?2/df, and Root Mean Squared Error of Approximation (RMSEA) showed the good fitness of the models. Conclusion: The results revealed that the pupils who had more confident, skills, expectation beliefs, and knowledge were more likely to perform proper spine-related behavior. In this regard, school-based low back pain prevention interventions should be addressed using key cognitive factors that consider the potential change strategies. © 2020, Iranian Institute for Health Sciences Research.

AB  - [Purpose] The aim of this study was to identify whether postural changes are prevalent with advancing age using a photogrammetric method performing one-year follow-up study. [Subjects and Methods] Thirty-eight schoolchildren were evaluated in 2011 and 2012 in this cohort study. The subjects underwent a postural evaluation, which involved palpation of reference anatomic points, placement of reflexive markers over the anatomic points, image acquisition, and point digitalization using the Digital Image-based Postural Assessment evaluation software. For data analysis, descriptive statistics and inferential statistics were analyzed by McNemar’s test. [Results] The results showed a significant increase in postural change prevalence for the lumbar spine in the sagittal plane (from 42.2% to 81.6%) and the knees in the frontal plane (from 39.5% to 63.2%) and a significant decrease in the prevalence of scoliosis (from 68.5% to 42.2%). [Conclusion] The findings indicate an increase in the prevalence of postural changes in schoolchildren from Teutônia, RS, Brazil, in 2012 compared with 2011. The development of longitudinal investigations for long-term monitoring of the evolution of posture and of schoolchildren habits’s representing a viable alternative to subsidize health actions. © 2016 The Society of Physical Therapy Science.

AB  - Objective: To propose and analyze the test-retest reliability of an instrument to verify the presence and intensity of pain in the cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine in Brazilian young people. Methods: This reliability study enrolled a sample of 458 participants (13 to 20 years). Two groups were formed for each sex according to the range of days for the test-retest (10±3 and 28±2 days). For analysis of spinal pain, a drawing of the human body with cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine areas delimited was presented. The following question was presented: during a normal day, do you feel pain in any of these regions of your spine? If so, what is the intensity from 0 to 10 (mark on the line)? The starting point, with the number 0, corresponded to no pain, and the number 10 to severe pain. The agreement of frequency and of intensity of pain was verified by Kappa test and Bland-Altman plot, respectively. Results: Intraclass correlation coefficients ranged from 0.71 (confidence interval of 95% — 95%CI — 0.59–0.79) to 0.94 (95%CI 0.90–0.96). The results concerning the agreement of pain scores showed the mean differences to be close to 0, and the largest mean difference was -0.40 (95%CI -5.14–4.34). The agreement in reported pain ranged from 72.2 (Kappa 0.43; 95%CI 0.28–0.58) to 90.1% (Kappa 0.76; 95%CI 0.60–0.92). Conclusions: This instrument was shown to be a reliable manner to verify the pain in different regions of the spine in Brazilian young people. © 2019 Sociedade de Pediatria de São Paulo.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the behaviour of postural variables and the associated factors, like back pain and life habits, in schoolchildren during a period of four years. Forty-two school children underwent a postural assessment using Digital Image-Based Postural Assessment software. They also answered the self-administered questionnaire titled, "Back Pain and Body Posture Evaluation Instrument" to evaluate their back pain and life habits. We observed a significant trend of forward head, thoracic hyper kyphosis, and lumbar hyper lordosis in the entire group, as well as a trend of cervical rectification in girls. Both boys and girls presented a constant frequency in back pain, but girls presented higher prevalence along the years. We found a high prevalence of poor sitting posture in male (between 72.2-89.5%) and female (between 73.3-100%). We also found that girls had poor posture due to the way they carried their school supplies. However, occurred a decrease of time spent in front of television for male (from 87% to 10.5%) and female (from 93.3% to 0%). Significant changes occurred in analysed variables over evaluation period. © Edições Desafio Singular.

AB  - Background. The impact of behavioral risk factors, specifically postural habits and the presence of postural changes, has been identified as a significant concern for adolescent females, particularly in public school settings. Purpose of the study. This study aims to conduct a comparative analysis of postural changes, behavioral postures, back pain, and behavioral habits between adolescent females in public and international schools. Methods. A case-control study was executed, involving 200 adolescent females aged 13–17 years. The participants were divided into two groups: Group (A) from public schools and Group (B) from international schools. The evaluation process employed a combination of video and image analysis using Kinova and the Back Pain and Body Posture Evaluation Instrument. Results. Statistical analysis revealed a lack of significant difference between Groups (A&B) concerning forward head posture (cranio-vertebral angle by Kinova). However, a notable distinction was observed between the groups in terms of back pain, behavioral habits, hereditary factors, and socioeconomic status. Conclusion. While both groups exhibited a prevalence of forward head posture among adolescent females, Group (A) from public schools demonstrated a higher incidence of back pain, associated with behavioral habits, socioeconomic factors and hereditary influences on back pain. Postural changes and back pain in public schools were attributed to factors such as load, duration of TV watching, lack of exercise, backpack-carrying duration, hereditary factors, and socioeconomic status (parents' education level up to secondary schools). © 2024, DJ Studio.

AB  - Back pain is a public health problem that affects adolescents and adults worldwide. However, studies on back pain present inconsistent findings in part due to the use of different instruments, especially for athletes. Therefore, the objective of this systematic review protocol was to map the existing evidence on such tools. The systematic review will be conducted according to PRISMA guidelines. Five electronic databases, Embase, MEDLINE, SPORTDiscus, CINAHL, and Scopus will be searched. This review includes studies that investigated prevalence, incidence, and other variables. Titles and abstracts will be selected. Two independent reviewers will read the articles carefully and discrepancies, if any, will be dealt with by a third reviewer. All steps will be completed with Rayyan for systematic reviews and the methodological quality will be analyzed with a COSMIN checklist. Discussion: This systematic review will gather evidence on tools that assess back pain in athletes. The findings may indicate the most appropriate tools for assessing back pain. They will contribute to better reliability, safe measurements, and help to standardize a comparison tool between different studies. They will also assist in the development of specific tools for athletes. Registration: This review was submitted and registered under CRD42020201299 in PROSPERO. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Objective: To analyze the prevalence of low back and neck pain in Physical Education (PE) students at the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS) and the associated behavioral and postural factors. Methods: The study design is observational with descriptive analytics. Healthy PE students of both sexes participated in the study and answered the Back Pain and Body Postural Evaluation Instrument for Adults. Data were analyzed using SPSS software (21.0) using descriptive statistics, calculating the prevalence ratios and 95% confidence intervals. The significance level adopted was 0.05. Results: Ninety-two PE students answered the questionnaire, 45 of whom were females (48.9%) and 47 of whom were males (51.1%). The prevalence of low back pain was 76.1% and of neck pain was 58.7%. There was no association with most of the behavioral and postural factors assessed. Conclusions: The prevalence of low back and neck pain in PE students at UFRGS is high and this pain is not associated with the factors investigated. © 2022 Oficial da Sociedade Brasileira de Coluna.

AB  - School-based interventions have reported effectiveness on back health; however, there are no specific guidelines for teaching body mechanics and posture in primary and secondary schools. To identify, describe, and analyze the educative features of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on back health developed to date in the school setting, a systematic review was performed following the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) recommendations. RCTs exclusively focused on educational setting electronic databases included PubMed, EMBASE, PEDro, Web of Science, SPORTDiscus, ERIC, and MEDLINE on the Ovid platform. Databases were searched for potentially eligible studies from the earliest date up to 18th March 2020. A total of 584 records were obtained from the database searches. A total of six articles that applied inclusion criteria were assessed for eligibility. All of these studies found improvements in postural habits and the level of knowledge with regard to back health, as well as a reduction in the prevalence of back pain. None of the studies used the student-centered method, and three studies used evaluation instruments with a pilot validation. Research on RCT interventions concerning back health in the school setting is scarce. None of the interventions applied a constructivist or student-centered method. The use of validated and standardized assessment instruments is required. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Background: Good posture is characterised by neutral spinal alignment with high physiological and biomechanical efficiency together with low stress and strain. The purpose of this study was to assess the validity and reproducibility of the adult version of the Aristegui questionnaire in university students. Materials and methods: The study was conducted in two parts. The first part assessed content validity of the questionnaire where five experts provided their feedback on the content of the questionnaire. The second part evaluated the reliability of the questionnaire among a convenience sample of 10 university students in a test–retest study. Results: The content validity of the questionnaire was found to be excellent. Twenty-five out of twenty-seven items had an item content validity index higher than 0.79 (appropriate) and the scale content validity index was 0.93 (high). For the reliability, almost perfect agreements were found for nine items, substantial agreement for three questions, moderate agreement for one item and fair agreement for one item. The kappa coefficients ranged from 0.00 (slight) to 1.00 (perfect) for the items on behaviour. Conclusions: The questionnaire was found to be a valid and reliable tool to measure the university students’ knowledge regarding ergonomics and posture and postural behaviour as well as prevalence of musculoskeletal pain. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - With the enforcement of social distancing due to the pandemic, a need to conduct postural assessments through remote care arose. So, this study aimed to assess the intra- and inter-rater reproducibility of the Remote Static Posture Assessment (ARPE) protocol’s Postural Checklist. The study involved 51 participants, with the postural assessment conducted by two researchers. For intra-rater reproducibility assessment, one rater administered the ARPE protocol twice, with an interval of 7–days between assessments (test–retest). A second independent rater assessed inter-rater reproducibility. Kappa statistics (k) and percentage agreement (%C) were used, with a significance level of 0.05. The intra-rater reproducibility analysis indicated high reliability, k values varied from 0.921 to 1.0, with %C ranging from 94% to 100% for all items on the ARPE protocol’s Postural Checklist. Interrater reproducibility indicates reliability ranging from slight to good, k values exceeded 0.4 for the entire checklist, except for four items: waists in the frontal photograph (k = 0.353), scapulae in the rear photograph (k = 0.310), popliteal line of the knees in the rear photograph (k = 0.270), and foot posture in the rear photograph (k = 0.271). Nonetheless, %C surpassed 50% for all but the scapulae item (%C = 47%). The ARPE protocol’s Postural Checklist is reproducible and can be administered by the same or different raters for static posture assessment. However, when used by distinct raters, the items waists (front of the frontal plane), scapulae, popliteal line of the knees, and feet (rear of the frontal plane) should not be considered.

AB  - Back pain is common in adolescents as a result of their typical daily activities. There is a critical need for developing instruments that can assess the adolescents’ knowledge of proper posture, because adequate postural habits are essential for preventing back pain and facilitating physical well-being. Unfortunately, there is insufficient understanding about appropriate back health in the general public, even though this knowledge is decisive in the development of physical skills and attainment of health literacy. Furthermore, relevant substantive literature is scarce. Therefore, the proposed systematic review aims to identify instruments that are used for assessing knowledge of back health in adolescents. Relevant search terms and descriptors will be combined, and searches will be carried out in a uniform sequence within the PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library databases. Eligible articles must present data on the assessment of the adolescents’ knowledge of back health and describe the applied instrumentation. Articles will be selected by two reviewers independently; all disagreements will be resolved by a third reviewer. Mendeley and the Rayyan software will be used for the systematic review, and the checklist proposed by Brink and Louw will be used to verify the methodological quality of the included studies. Our findings may confirm the relevance of constructing and validating back health instruments for use in Brazil and other countries. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Introduction: Back Pain and Body Posture Evaluation Instrument for Adults (BackPEI-A) lags the most recent literature, as it does not assess issues related to activity increasingly present in the daily lives of people of all ages. Purpose: (1) to update the BackPEI-A by including four new questions regarding the use of mobile devices; (2) to present a new graphic design of the issues related to back and neck pain to facilitate understanding of the location of these pains; (3) to test the content validity and the reliability of the new questions; and (4) to identify whether the BackPEI-A version in online form has adequate reliability. Methods: The content validation by evaluation of eight experts, and the reliability of the new questions and of the online version were assessed. The new questions were translated to English. Content validation was assessed by the content validity index (CVI). Reliability was assessed using the agreement percentage (%C), the kappa statistic (k), and the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). k > 0.4 and %C > 0.5 were assumed to include new questions. Results: The new questions showed good agreement among the experts, k > 0.4 and %C > 0.5. Both forms applied presented an average kappa of total sample ranging from moderate to good, and moderate ICC values, showing an adequate reliability. Conclusion: The updated BackPEI-A is valid and reliable and allows the identification of aspects related to back and neck pain, as well as possible risk factors. © 2023

AB  - The prevalence of back pain (BP) among children and adolescents has increased over recent years. Some authors advocate promoting back-health education in the school setting. It is therefore important to adopt a uniform suite of assessment instruments to measure the various constructs. The present study aimed to perform a cultural adaptation of a validated measurement instrument (BackPEI), beginning with a translation and cultural adaptation phase, followed by a second phase to test reliability using a test-retest design. The translation and cross-cultural adaptation were performed based on the guidelines. Reliability was tested by applying the questionnaire to 224 secondary school students, at two different times with a 7-day interval between the tests. In general, the Spanish version presented adequate agreement for questions 1–20, with only question 9 achieving a low Kappa range of 0.312 (−0.152–0.189). The question about pain intensity did not show differences between the test means (4.72 ± 2.33) and re-test (4.58 ± 2.37) (p = 0.333), and the responses for these two tests obtained a high correlation (ICC = 0.951 (0.928–0.966); p = 0.0001). Psychometric testing indicated that the Spanish version of the BackPEI is well-adapted and reliable, based on the test–retest design, providing similar results to the original Brazilian version. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Purpose: The aim of the study was to evaluate musculoskeletal pain due to mechanical reasons and related risk factors in adolescents and to define posture profiles of adolescents. Design: A cross-sectional study. Methods: The study was conducted with 2221 adolescents between February 2015 and May 2015. The questionnaire used to collect data consisted of three parts: (1) descriptive characteristics of the participants, (2) pain assessment of 14 parts of the body, and (3) Back Pain and Body Posture Evaluation Instrument (BackPEI). Results: The prevalence of low back pain among the participants was 73.3% (n = 1,343), while the prevalence of back pain was 68.4% (n = 1,254). The participants attributed their pain to their poor sitting postures at school (38.1%, n = 847) and carrying school backpacks (84.1%, n = 1,713). There was a statistically significant difference in the physical activities of adolescents and the BackPEI score (z = 4.40; p = .001). Posture factors of the BackPEI score increased while school desk comfort score increased (Spearman's rho = 0.148; p = .001), but it decreased while the school grades of the adolescents increased (Spearman's rho [ρ] = −0.161; p = .001). Conclusions: According to this study, body posture was related to musculoskeletal pain and was correlated with physical activities, school desk comfort, and school grades of the adolescents. It is suggested that correct posture and ergonomic positions should be taught to adolescents when using computers, carrying school backpacks, and sitting in school chairs to prevent musculoskeletal pain. © 2020 American Society for Pain Management Nursing

AB  - The aim of this study was verify the prevalence and back pain (BP) intensity, and risk factors associated with an elevated level of pain intensity in schoolchildren of basic education from Teutônia, RS. 1597 students from 5th to 8th grade participated in this epidemiological study. Data were collected through a self‐administered questionnaire and analyzed from a multivariable analysis and from the calculation of prevalence ratios (PR) (α=0.05). Were verified that the prevalence of BP in last three months was 55.7% (n = 802) and the elevated level of BP is associated with variables: pain frequency (PR = 1.37; p = 0.001), impediment to perform activities of daily life (PR = 1.25; p = 0.001) and transportation of school supplies (PR = 1,10; p = 0,026). These results may assist physical education teachers to plan their teaching activities. © 2015 Colégio Brasileiro de Ciências do Esporte

AB  - Objective To investigate the association between behavioral risk factors, specifically postural habits, with the presence of structural changes in the spine of children and adolescents. Methods 59 students were evaluated through the self-reporting Back Pain and Body Posture Evaluation Instrument e and the spine panoramic radiographic examination. The spine curvatures were classified, based on Cobb' angle, as normal or altered in the saggital plane and as normal or scoliotic in the frontal plane. Data were analyzed using SPSS 18.0, from descriptive statistics and chi-square association test (α=0,05). Results The prevalence of postural alterations was 79.7% (n=47), of which 47.5% (n=28) showed frontal plane alterations and 61% (n=36) sagital plane alterations. Significant association was found between the presence of thoracic kyphosis and female gender, practice of physical exercise only once or twice a week, sleep time greater than 10 hours, inappropriate postures to sit on the bench and sit down to write, and transport of school supplies. Lumbar lordosis was associated with improperly transportation of school backpack (asymmetric); and scoliosis was associated wuth the practice of competitive sport and sleep time greater than 10 hours. Conclusions Lifestyle may be associated with postural alterations. It is important to develop health policies in order to reduce the prevalence of postural alterations with a reduction of associated risk factors. © 2014 Associação de Pediatria de São Paulo.

AB  - Background: Text neck is regarded as a global epidemic. Yet, there is a lack of consensus concerning the definitions of text neck which challenges researchers and clinicians alike. Purpose: To investigate how text neck is defined in peer-reviewed articles. Methods: We conducted a scoping review to identify all articles using the terms “text neck” or “tech neck.” Embase, Medline, CINAHL, PubMed and Web of Science were searched from inception to 30 April 2022. We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMAScR) guidelines. No limitation was applied for language or study design. Data extraction included study characteristics and the primary outcome relating to text neck definitions. Results: Forty-one articles were included. Text neck definitions varied across studies. The most frequent components of definitions were grouped into five basis for definition: Posture (n = 38; 92.7%), with qualifying adjectives meaning incorrect posture (n = 23; 56.1%) and posture without a qualifying adjective (n = 15; 36.6%); Overuse (n = 26; 63.4%); Mechanical stress or tensions (n = 17; 41.4%); Musculoskeletal symptoms (n = 15; 36.6%) and; Tissue damage (n = 7; 17.1%). Conclusion: This study showed that posture is the defining characteristic of text neck in the academic literature. For research purposes, it seems that text neck is a habit of texting on the smartphone in a flexed neck position. Since there is no scientific evidence linking text neck with neck pain regardless of the definition used, adjectives like inappropriate or incorrect should be avoided when intended to qualify posture. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Introduction: Remote postural assessment, necessary during the pandemic, required strategies to replace its in-person counterpart. Objective: Analyze the content validity of a protocol for Remote Static Posture Assessment (ARPE) that includes three items, postural checklist, rater’s manual and ratee’s manual. Methods: Six experts in postural assessment were invited to validate the content of the three items of the ARPE protocol and 10 laypersons evaluated the ratee’s Manual. The validity questionnaire encompassed the protocol in general and each individual item, containing an area for suggestions from experts and laypersons. The responses of these raters were used to calculate the Content Validity Indexes (CVI). Results: Two rounds of evaluations were carried out with the experts and one with the laypersons. In the first round with the experts, the CVI ranged from 98.6 to 83%. Three aspects (description of head positioning, description of scapula and waist positioning in the frontal plane) required adjustments. In the first round with the laypersons and second round with the experts, the CVI was 100%. Conclusion: The 100% agreement between experts and laypersons regarding the content of the ARPE protocol confirms its content validity. © Open access and CC-BY licensed

AB  - It is well-known that low back pain (LBP) prevalence is high among school-age children. However, literature concerning the initial onset of back pain between the ages of three and eleven years is scarce. The present study aims to analyze the prevalence of LBP in kindergarten and primary school students. A total of 278 (9.9 ± 2.1 years old; 52.2% girls) students from two public kindergartens and primary schools in Valencia (Spain) participated in this cross-sectional study. The Nordic questionnaire on LBP was used to assess the onset and duration of LBP symptoms. The lifetime prevalence of LBP was 47.5% (n = 132), the last year’s prevalence was 44.2% (n = 123), and last week’s prevalence was 18.8% (n = 50). Boys and girls reported a lifetime prevalence of 52.3% (n = 64) and 47.7% (n = 63) (p = 0.186, Fisher’s exact test, 2-sided), respectively. By age group, lifetime episodes of LBP became more prevalent with increasing age (p < 0.001, Fisher’s exact test, 2-sided). In summary, our findings show that LBP increases with age and further strengthens the evidence that LBP onset could start as young as 10 years of age. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Back pain in athletes varies with sport, age, and sex, which can impair athletic performance, thereby contributing to retirement. Studies on back pain in this population use questionnaires to assess components, such as pain intensity and location and factors associated with pain, among others. This study aimed to review validated questionnaires that have assessed back pain in athletes. This systematic review was conducted according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) by searching the databases Embase, MEDLINE, SPORTDiscus, CINAHL, and Scopus. The articles were selected regardless of language and date of publication. Titles and abstracts were independently selected by two reviewers; disagreements were resolved by a third reviewer. All the steps were conducted using the software Rayyan. The methodological quality of the questionnaire validation articles was assessed using a critical appraisal tool checklist proposed by Brink and Louw. The search returned 4748 articles, of which 60 were selected for this review, including 5 questionnaire validation studies. These articles were published between 2004 and 2022, which were performed in more than 20 countries, particularly Germany (14) and Sweden (5). Thirteen different instruments were identified, of which 46.1% were developed in Europe. The most commonly used questionnaires were the Oswestry Disability Index and Nordic Standardized Questionnaire. In addition, five questionnaire validation studies were selected for methodological quality assessment, with only two studies demonstrating high methodological quality. The following three instruments were identified for assessing back pain specifically in athletes: Micheli Functional Scale, Persian Functional Rating Index, and Athlete Disability Index. This review confirmed that all three instruments were specifically designed to assess this condition. © 2023 Azevedo et al.

AB  - Thoracic spine pain (TSP) is a common condition in the general adult population, with a similar prevalence in children and adolescents. An in-depth understanding of risk factors can assist in the identification of potential targets for effective prevention strategies. This study aimed to determine the incidence of TSP and ongoing TSP and identify its predictors in high school students. This longitudinal study was conducted in 2017 (baseline-T1), and follow-up surveys were completed in 2018 (T2). The variable “thoracic spine pain” was observed using the Nordic questionnaire, and associated variables were observed through the Baecke questionnaire and the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. Statistical association methods were used for bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis. Among the participants, the one-year prevalence (ongoing TSP) was 38.4%, and the one-year incidence (new TSP) was 10.1%. Significant risk factors for ongoing TSP were adolescent females (RR = 2.14), in the age group of 15 to 18 years (RR = 1.41), clinical mental health problems (RR = 3.07), borderline mental health problems (RR = 2.02), mental health problems, sitting while using a tablet (RR = 1.93), distance of the eye from cell phone screen of or more than 20 cm (RR = 1.69), distance of the eye from the PC screen of or more than 30 cm (RR = 1.53), cell phone mobile use duration of or more than 3 h (RR = 1.60), tablet use time of or more than 3 h (RR = 2.08), and semi-lying prone position while using the cell phone (RR= 1.47), and these were also significant predictors of TSP episodes. Significant risk factors for new TSP were adolescent female sex (RR = 1.88), level, clinical mental health problems (RR = 4.26), borderline mental health problems (RR = 2.07), semi-lying prone position while using cell phone (RR = 1.71) or tablet (RR = 2.31), and mobile phone use duration equal to or greater than 3 h (RR = 1.72). We conclude that there is a high prevalence of TSP in high school students, which is associated with the female sex, mental health problems, and use of electronic devices for an inappropriate duration in an improper position. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Risk factors associated with back pain vary in different countries. Given the lack of studies in Latin America, our study aimed to assess back pain and its associated factors for six years in Southern Brazilian school children. All children attending the fifth grade of Teutônia, Brazil, were invited to participate in the study. Only schoolchildren who did not report back pain were included in the first assessment. The schoolchildren completed the Back Pain and Body Posture Evaluation Instrument (BackPEI) during three assessments (2011, 2014, and 2017). BackPEI assesses the presence of back pain and possible associated risk factors (postural, behavioral, and sociodemographic). Generalized estimated equations (GEE) were used to perform a Poisson regression model with robust variance for longitudinal analysis. After six years of follow-up, 75 schoolchildren completed all the assessments. The risk factors associated with back pain were spending more than six hours daily watching television, lifting objects from the ground adopting an inadequate posture, using another backpack type different from those with two straps, and carrying a backpack in an asymmetric way. These results are important in guiding the planning of public policies to minimize this public health problem. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - The Back Pain and Body Posture Evaluation Instrument (BackPEI) was created in 2013 to assess back pain and its risk factors in school children. However, it does not assess neck pain or the habits of mobile device usage, which are aspects that are often part of school children’s lives. Therefore, we aimed to update the BackPEI questionnaire to include new questions assessing aspects related to neck pain and the use of mobile devices and to test the content validity and reliability of the new questions. The updated questionnaire was named Back Pain and Body Posture Evaluation Instrument for Children and Adolescents (BackPEI-CA). The content was validated by eight experts using the content validity index (CVI). To assess reliability, the BackPEI-CA questionnaire was applied at two different times in 105 school children, and Cohen’s kappa (k) and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) were calculated. All aspects assessed regarding content validity had a CVI higher than 0.8. The new questions presented moderate and good kappa values and excellent ICC values. The updated version of BackPEI-CA can be used as a clinic tool for assessing the presence, frequency, and intensity of back and neck pain and their risk factors. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Objectives: Following a search conducted in several databases, no instrument was found that jointly evaluates the prevalence of back pain and its associated demographic, social-economic, hereditary, behavioral and postural risk factors. Thus, the present study aims to develop the Back Pain and Body Posture Evaluation Instrument (BackPEI) for school-age children and verify its validity and reproducibility. Methods: Twenty-one questions were elaborated to compose the BackPEI instrument, eight experts checked the content validity, and its reproducibility was tested by applying the questionnaire to 260 primary schoolchildren, at two different times with a 7-day interval. Results: The reproducibility data for the first 20 questions, analyzed using the kappa (k) coefficient, were classified as very good (k > 0.8) or good (0.6 < k ≤ 0.8). The reproducibility data for the pain intensity question, analyzed using the Wilcoxon test and the intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), demonstrated that there was no difference between the averages (p = 0.251) and the responses were highly correlated (ICC = 0.937) for these two tests. Conclusions: The BackPEI constitutes a valid and reproducible instrument which is relevant for the evaluation of back pain and its associated risk factors. © 2012 Swiss School of Public Health.

AB  - The current randomized controlled trial aimed to investigate the effects of a postural education program on daily life habits related to low back pain (LBP) in children. Reducing the disease burden of unspecific LBP in children is of major public health relevance, as children with episodes of LBP tend to experience chronic back pain in adulthood. The study was performed in Majorca (Spain), with 253 primary school children aged between 10 and 12 years. The sample was selected from different clusters (schools) using convenience sampling and randomly distributed into an experimental group (5 schools) or a control group (5 schools). Individual postural items did not improve after the intervention in the experimental group, nor did they improve in the control group. Neither did they improve postural habits score in both groups after the intervention. In conclusion, this telematic intervention has not managed to improve postural habits in children. Nevertheless, there is a lack of evidence to determine whether it is feasible to carry out telematics intervention that promotes lifestyle changes in children.

AB  - This study aimed to determine the prevalence of inadequate habits of Elementary students of the city of Teutônia, state of Rio Grande do Sul from a population study. The 1597 school participants completed the Back Pain and Body Posture Evaluation Instrument (BackPEI) self-administered questionnaire. The results showed a high prevalence of inappropriate postural habits in the following positions: sitting to write and to use the computer, sitting on a bench, and picking up objects from the ground. It was also found that students remain long time sitting in front of the computer and television, and that they do not sleep the required hours per day. Studies like this are important because their results provide direct educational work.

AB  - In cervical health, the Posture Monitoring System (PMS) employs sensors to capture and transmit posture data to the cloud via Wi-Fi. This systematic review examines wearable PMS devices for cervical posture, analysing their attributes, findings, and limitations. Using systematic literature analysis, related studies were collected from diverse databases concentrating on wearable cervical posture devices. The review analysed the outcomes of each neck posture and each monitor type on the CVA ratio based on PMS. However, limitations, such as small sample sizes, limited functions, and privacy concerns were noted across the devices. The findings underscore the importance of considering user comfort and data accuracy in designing and implementing wearable posture monitors. Future studies should also explore the integration of advanced technologies and user-centred design principles to develop more accurate and user-friendly devices. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the effects of Eutony, Holistic Gymnastics, and Pilates on hamstring flexibility and back pain in pre-adolescent girls. Methods: This randomized prospective quantitative clinical trial compared the effects of Eutony, Holistic Gymnastics, and Pilates on hamstring flexibility and back pain. The sample consisted of 80 pre-adolescent girls aged 10–13 years and divided into three groups: Eutony, with 26 girls; Holistic Gymnastics, 27 girls; and Pilates, 27 girls. The participants underwent ten 1-h weekly interventions. Hamstring flexibility was evaluated using fingertip-to-floor, sit-and-reach, and hip angle tests; back pain was evaluated using the Body Posture Evaluation Instrument questionnaire and the way they carried their backpack by the Layout for Assessing Dynamic Posture. Descriptive statistical analysis, analysis of variance, and Kruskal–Wallis test were performed at a 5 % significance level (p < 0.05). Results: The three body practices increased hamstring flexibility in all fingertip-to-floor (7.77 cm), hip angle (5.58°), and sit-and-reach evaluations (9.07 cm). Before the intervention, 66.25 % of participants complained of back pain. After the intervention, only 37.50 % continued with the complaint. Moreover, 25 % of pre-adolescent girls started to carry their school backpack correctly. Conclusion: Eutony, Holistic Gymnastics, and Pilates increased hamstring flexibility, reduced back pain complaints, and incentivized the girls to carry the school backpack correctly.

AB  - There is a paucity of information regarding the development of body posture during adolescence. This three-year prospective study aimed to evaluate sitting and sleeping postures among adolescents, and to determine whether these postures are associated with age and sex. We assessed 525 adolescents aged 11-16 years from the fifth to eighth grades. These adolescents were reassessed three years later. The Back Pain and Body Posture Evaluation Instrument was used to evaluate the sleeping posture and three sitting positions: sitting to write, to use a computer, and during leisure activities. Our findings indicated a low prevalence of adequate sleeping and sitting postures at baseline, with a decrease in prevalence observed after three years for all postures. These changes were similar for both sexes. Moreover, we found a strong reduction of adequate posture prevalence for younger adolescents, but the oldest adolescents demonstrated no significant differences after three years. Early, rather than late, adolescence is a critical period for establishing inadequate sitting and sleeping postures. This has implications for posture throughout adulthood; hence, interventions targeted at this age group are needed. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Aim: The aim of this paper is to analyze hospital admission and associated factors following presentation to healthcare facilities for low back pain (LBP) in Ethiopia. Methods: A population-based cross-sectional study was conducted between June and November 2018 in South-west Shewa zone of Oromia regional state. Data were collected by face-to-face interviews of adults (≥18 years) with self-reported LBP using a newly developed and validated instrument. All the statistical analyses of (n = 543) individuals with a 1-year history of presentation to healthcare facilities for LBP were performed using R version 3.5.1. The log-binomial regression model was fitted and prevalence ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to identify factors associated with hospitalization and the significance level was considered at the P value of ≤.05. Results: The proportion of hospital admissions following presentation to healthcare facilities for LBP was 14.4%, 95% CI 11.4-17.3, with an average length of stay (LOS) 7.4 days, 95% CI 6.4-8.8. The admission rate was 18.5%, 95% CI 13.4-23.3 in females and 11.4%, 95% CI 8.0-15.1 in males. Multiple factors, such as gender, age, living conditions, residential environment, alcohol consumption status, intensity of pain, and presence of additional spinal pain, were found to be independently associated with hospitalization for LBP. Conclusions: The burden on the individuals and the Ethiopian healthcare system as a result of LBP is evident by the rate of hospital admissions. Further evidence on LBP case referral procedures is needed to allow health policy makers to develop appropriate management strategies capable of dealing with the increasing epidemiology of LBP. © 2020 Asia Pacific League of Associations for Rheumatology and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd

AB  - Background: Athletes put their health at short- and long-term risk and a detailed investigation of health outcomes is important because it should allow the development of more specific interventions. This study aimed to evaluate the health-related determinants of eating pattern of high school athletes. Methods: The study enrolled 248 Brazilian athletes aged 14-20 years. Eating pattern outcomes included skipping breakfast, vegetable and fruit consumption, and sweets consumption. The following factors were considered as independent variables: sociodemographic, economic, anthropometry, body weight control, psychosocial, sedentary behavior, sleeping time, meals, alcohol and smoking, and strength variables. Data were analyzed using Poisson regression model and the effect measure was the prevalence ratio (PR). Results: The results showed that 45.6% of the athletes skipped breakfast, 29.8% ate sweets regularly, and only 8.9% consumed vegetables and fruit regularly. Multiple analysis revealed the following positive associations: breakfast skipping and vomiting or using laxatives to lose weight (PR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.01-1.26); low fruit and vegetable consumption and using pills to lose weight (PR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.02-1.07); high sweets consumption and female athletes (PR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.12-1.55); high sweets consumption and more than 2 h spent watching TV (PR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.02-1.39). Conclusions: Our findings indicated that sociodemographic, body weight control and sedentary factors are determinants on eating patterns of high school athletes.  © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Low back pain (LBP) is the leading cause of disability in the world that affects the population of all ages globally. The main aim of the present study was to analyze the cross-sectional association of postural education and postural hygiene habits with LBP, differentiating between frequency and intensity of pain. Methods: This cross-sectional study assessed 849 students aged 10-12 years from primary schools. The study was based on four different structured and self-administered questionnaires: back pain questionnaire, Back Pain and Body Posture Evaluation Instrument (BackPEI), Frequency of Commuting to and from School Questionnaire, and the Hebacaknow questionnaire. In addition, height and weight were included to determine the body mass index (BMI). Results: Participants with prevalence of LBP were significantly older (P= 0.038), girls (P< 0.001), taller (P= 0.018), and practice active travelled back from school (P= 0.016). Otherwise, participants with no prevalence of LBP sat correctly at the desk (P< 0.001). Higher knowledge of postural education was associated with lower intensity of LBP (β = -0.07, CI = -0.12 – -0.02, P= 0.004). Conclusion: The knowledge related to postural education it is associated with less LBP. School interventions improving knowledge about postural education, ergonomics and postural hygiene are needed to address this important matter. © 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - Introduction: Postural changes frequently occur in pre-adolescent girls, with sedentary lifestyle with reduced physical activity level as one of the risk factors. Objective: To investigate the effects of Eutonia, Holistic Gymnastics, and Pilates on body posture in pre-adolescent girls. Methods: A randomized prospective quantitative clinical trial was conducted. The study included girls aged 10–13 years and compared the effects of Eutonia, Holistic Gymnastics, and Pilates on body posture. The sample comprised 80 girls divided into three intervention groups as follows: Eutonia group, 26 girls; Holistic Gymnastics group, 27 girls; and Pilates group, 27 girls. Ten sessions of 1 h each were conducted on a weekly basis. Static posture was analyzed using the Postural Analysis Software SAPO; dynamic posture, using the modified Layout for Assessing Dynamic Posture LADy; and lifestyle, using the Body Posture Evaluation Instrument Back PEI questionnaire. The data were statistically analyzed using the analysis of variance (ANOVA) by Kruskal-Wallis’ averages test at 5% significance level (p < 0,05). Results: The results showed that the three body movement practices improved the head inclination in the frontal plane (1,49°) and pelvic anteversion in the right (1,9°) and left profiles (2,09°). In addition, 25% of pre-teens started to carry their school bag correctly, improving their posture. Conclusion: The body movement practices of Eutonia, Holistic Gymnastics, and Pilates improved head inclination, pelvic anteversion, and the correctness rate of carrying the schoolbag. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The purpose of this study was to develop a questionnaire to assess body posture habits in adolescents’ daily activities. To develop and assess the instrument we used the Delphi method, and a test-retest reliability design. The questionnaire consisted of 31questions with 4-level Likert scale. One hundred and sixty-eight students were studied, 72 girls and 96 boys, between the ages of 13 and 17 (14.47 ± 1.26). Cronbach’s alpha (α =.80) showed a high internal consistency. Test-retest reliability was excellent for total score (.85), with good results for standard error of measure (0.07) and minimal detectable change (0.20). The one-sample t-test showed non-differences between mean differences of total scores (−0.01), and the limits of agreement of the Bland-Altman plot showed a narrow error of measurement range (−0.34, 0.37). Our questionnaire is a valid and reliable instrument for assessing students’ postural habits during activities in their daily lives. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Background: Back school programs, that improve back care and spine disease prevention knowledge are recommended at the age of 4-14 years. There is Health Questionnaire on Back Care Knowledge in the literature for children aged 14-17 years. At other ages, there is no questionnaire examining this knowledge. We aimed to develop a Health Questionnaire on Back Care and Spine Disease Prevention Knowledge for 6-10 years old children and validate its psychometric properties (internal consistency, test-retest reliability, agreement, convergent validity, discriminant validity) in 6-10 years old children, who attended back school program or not. Methods: 463 children took part in the research (6-10 years old). The development was performed according to the Delphi method. The final version contained 7 questions. 463 participants completed the questionnaire twice with an interval of 7 days to evaluate test-retest reliability. The internal consistency was tested by Cronbach’s alpha value, test–retest reliability was calculated by Intraclass Correlation Coefficients (ICC), Standard Error of Measurement (SEM) and 95% of Minimal Detectable Change (MDC95) and Bland–Altman plots. Convergent validity was tested against the age variable and discriminant validity was tested by Kruskal-Wallis tests among the different subgroups. Results: Cronbach’s alpha of the total score was (α=0.797), showed a strong internal consistency with minimal SEM (0.606) and MDC95 (1.680). The test-retest result for the total score was strong (0.989), for the questions showed moderate to strong results (0.742-0.975), the limits of agreement of the Bland-Altman plot showed a narrow error of measurement range (-3.49-1.29), and the value of mean differences was −1.10 (SD ± 1.22). The convergent validity showed a weak, but significant relationship between total score and age (R=0.171; p < 0.001). The discriminant validity showed significantly different mean scores in non-back school and back school groups. Conclusion: For the examination of back care and spine disease prevention knowledge of 6-10 years old children, the questionnaire proved to be a valid and reliable tool. The knowledge requested in the questionnaire covers the knowledge material of the theoretical part of the back school for children aged 4-10 years. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Slouch back is the posture abnormality that becomes especially widespread among young people due to excessive use of computers. Shoulder index is convenient measure to evaluate rounded shoulder. It is calculated as the ratio of shoulder width measured between acromial processes from the front side of patient to the shoulder arch, measured from the back of the patient. The paper presents an attempt to evaluate shoulder index and shoulder roundness by means of photogrammetric measurements instead of measurements "in nature", with the further goal to implement developed technique in health monitoring system. For this one used set of anatomical landmarks, easily defined from the photograph. Unfortunately, proposed measurements did not allow evaluate neither shoulder arches nor shoulder index itself quantitatively. The front shoulder angle, calculates using quasiacromion - anathomical landmark defined from the side view photograph measurements - may be used to test shoulder roundness with sensitivity 0.81 and specifity 0.69. In females, two qualitative parameters may be used to test shoulder roundness: armpit protraction (S = 0.86, Sp = 0.80) and armpit tilt angle (S = 1.00, Sp = 0.90). Besides, this test does not work in males. © Springer International Publishing Swit zerland 2014.

AB  - Introduction: The objective of this study was to adapt the Brazilian version, and verify the validity, reliability and internal consistency of the Oliveira questionnaire on low back pain in young people. Material and Methods: The questionnaire was translated from European Portuguese into Brazilian Portuguese by means of translation and re-translation. The validity of the contents was determined by experts who analyzed the clarity and pertinence of the questions. Fifteen young people aged 15 to 18 took part in the pre-test step (qualitative analysis), 40 in the test-retest (reliability) and 679 in the evaluation of internal consistency. The intra-class correlation coefficient and Spearman’s correlation coefficient were used in the reliability analysis (test-retest), and Cronbach’s alpha to determine the internal consistency (stability). Results: In the translation phase the questionnaire was modified and considered suitable, observing similarity and equivalence of the two versions. After being corrected by the experts in the validation of the contents, the instrument was considered suitable and valid, and in the pre-test, the young people suggested some modifications to make the questionnaire more succinct. With respect to reliability, the values for the intra-class correlation coefficient were between 0.512-acceptable and 1-excellent and Spearman’s correlation coefficient varied between 0.525 and 1, classifying the instrument as reproducible. The internal consistency was considered acceptable with a 0.757 Cronbach’s alpha. Discussion: The Oliveira questionnaire was choosen since it has been used in several Portuguese studies; moreover, it addresses the need to raise data regarding low back pain and associated risk factors. Conclusions: The Brazilian version of the Oliveira questionnaire on low back pain in young people showed valid and reliable cultural adaptation, with good reliability and stability. © Ordem dos Médicos 2017.

AB  - Background: The weight of Schoolbag in childrens school is an important issue within education and general health. Schoolbag overweight can cause back pain in children, which may lead to chronic back problems in adulthood. The aim of this study is to evaluate the relation between the weight of school bag and backache among primary school pupils in Tikrit city. Subject and method: A cross sectional study is conducted inTikrit primary schools from the first of November 2018 to the end of March 2019 among primary school pupils. Sample size included 252 pupils, 130 were females and 122 were males. Two school chosen by cluster sampling, the pupils were chosen by stratified then simple random sampling methods,the data collected by using a questionnaire which was administered by the interviewers the students were examined to exclude any present congenital anomalies. Results: From the total sample of 252 pupils 74 (29.4%) pupils report backache from those 43 (58%) were females and 31 (42%) were males. The sequence of the location of back pain was upper as (59.4%) backache then middle (33.6%) and very few pupils have lower backache (7%). The relation between bag weight/pupil weight percentage and positive backache in primary school pupils from the total 74 pupils suffering from backache 41 (55.4%) has the percentage of bag weight/pupil weight more than 15%, 26 (35.1%) pupils had it between 10%-15% and only 7 pupils (9.5%) had it below 10%.The back pain is most commonly reported among those who come walking to the school. Conclusion:The study concluded that 74 (29.4%) of primary school pupils complained from backache among those 43 (58%) were females and 31 (42%) were males. © 2020, World Informations Syndicate.

AB  - Undergraduate Research (UR) is an institutional program that introduces undergraduate students to scientific research. The program selects research projects proposed by advisors and students for execution. Despite the importance of knowing the stages of research activities in undergraduate research, only a few studies have evaluated data on this subject. Therefore, this study aims to outline an overview of UR in a Brazilian educational institution, considering the profiles of students and advisors, students’ scientific productions, and perceptions about the experience of both. The study was a mixed-approach case study conducted through a questionnaire and interviews. The sample consisted of 213 undergraduate students and 167 UR supervisors. The results show that the largest group of students were aged 21 and 22 (46.6%) and supervisors 33 to 38 years (38.9%). Regarding the scientific productions of students, those who participated twice or more in undergraduate research had higher indicators compared to those who were participating for the first time. Students’ perceptions of their evolution and perceptions of the advisors were mostly positive, with a greater number of responses classified as very good to good. Thus, the satisfaction of researchers in being part of this experience was perceived and the need to improve the scientific production indicators of students, mediated by the advisors stimulating the writing of articles, abstracts, and books, as well as participation in events and patent development, was shown. We conclude that undergraduate research activities promote the integral development of students’ academic, scientific, personal, and professional terms, which ultimately reflect critical and emancipatory actions in society. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Several studies have shown that half of all young athletes experience back pain (BP). However, high intensity and frequency of BP may be harmful, and the factors associated with BP severity have not been investigated in detail. Here, we investigated the factors associated with a high intensity and high frequency of BP in high school athletes. We included 251 athletes (173 boys and 78 girls [14-20 years old]) in this cross-sectional study. The dependent variables were a high frequency and high intensity of BP, and the independent variables were demographic, socioeconomic, psychosocial, hereditary, anthropometric, behavioural, and postural factors and the level of exercise. The effect measure is presented as prevalence ratio (PR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Of 251 athletes, 104 reported BP; thus, only these athletes were included in the present analysis. Results of multivariable analysis showed an association between high BP intensity and time spent using a computer (PR: 1.15, CI: 1.01-1.33), posture while writing (PR: 1.41, CI: 1.27-1.58), and posture while using a computer (PR: 1.39, CI: 1.26-1.54). Multivariable analysis also revealed an association of high BP frequency with studying in bed (PR: 1.19, CI: 1.01-1.40) and the method of carrying a backpack (PR: 1.19, CI: 1.01-1.40). In conclusion, we found that behavioural and postural factors are associated with a high intensity and frequency of BP. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to compare different intensities and frequencies of BP, and our results may help physicians and coaches to better understand BP in high school athletes. © 2017 Noll et al.

AB  - Introduction: Scoliosis is a deformity of the spine that presents with a ‘S’ or ‘C’ curve with the most common type called Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS). The deformity begins unnoticed and can rapidly progress into severe deformation during the adolescent’s growth spurt. Factors such as onset of puberty, dietary intake, physical activity and ethnicity contributes to the development of AIS. Therefore, this study aims to determine the association of these factors with the prevalence of AIS among female school children in Kuala Langat. Methods: A total of 374 students between age 10 and 12 from six different primary schools in Kuala Langat were recruited according to the inclusion criteria. Consent form and questionnaire was distributed to the student’s parents/guardian prior conducting the research. Adam’s Forward Bend Test was performed to measure the rotation of the trunk using a smartphone Scoliometer Application. Results:Out of 374 students, 21 students from schools in Kuala Langat were found positive for AIS with a prevalence rate of 5.6%. However, no association was seen between the student’s age of menarche, dairy intake, frequency in physical activity and ethnicity with the prevalence of AIS. Conclusion: The factors measured in this study showed no association with the prevalence of AIS among school children in Kuala Langat. © 2021 UPM Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - One of the concerns of educational and health authorities, parents, and professionals from different sectors is the incorrect use of the school backpack and its repercussions on the musculoskeletal system, especially on the back. Health Literacy education programs have been carried out in the primary and secondary education system with the aim of preventing musculoskeletal disorders in children and adolescents and initiatives are being taken to reduce the weight that students carry in their backpacks. The aim of the current study is to investigate the effects of a postural education program on backpack use habits related to LBP in schoolchildren aged 10-12 years. This randomized controlled trial (RCT) was carried out in Majorca (Spain), with 224 primary schoolchildren aged 10 to 12. The sample was selected from different clusters (schools) using convenience sampling and randomly distributed into an experimental group (5 schools) or a control group (5 schools). A 16-week intervention program was implemented, which was carried out telematically because it was in times of COVID-19. Three structured and self-administered questionnaires were used to examine the prevalence of low back pain and backpack use habits. Results showed how backpack habits and single questions related to the use of backpack did not improve after the intervention in the experimental group, and in the control group also. The main conclusion is that no improvements were observed in the intervention group attributable to the effect of the intervention. © 2023 Vidal-Conti, licensee EURJHM.
